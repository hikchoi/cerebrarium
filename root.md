# Cerebrarium

> **Where I sow my cerebral seeds and tend to them.**

I have been consuming information passively for too long.

# Strategy

1. Start with the [Amoeba](https://www.dendron.so/notes/e780000d-c784-4945-8e42-35218a3ecf10.html) pattern.

3. Discover recurring structures and define schema later.

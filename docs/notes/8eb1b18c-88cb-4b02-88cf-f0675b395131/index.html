<p>It seems like the Eurorack gods don't want me to have vcas.</p>
<p>Every time I decide to build a new module I forget that I need a VCA. Maybe it's because I find it boring? It's an essential part of a modular system but on paper it's such a simple device.</p>
<p>This time I finally remembered to plan a Veils build, but I recieved a blemished panel, which rubbed me in the wrong way. Coincidentally, good panels are out of stock and I will have to wait a few weeks / months to get a replacement. Many angry e-mails have been sent back and forth with the vendor.</p>
<p>I eventually calmed down and ordered the required components for the build. However I realized later on that the PCBs are a 0603 adaptation of Veils and I ordered 0402 components. Some kind of karma I guess.</p>
<p>This is not a huge problem though. I have a few options from here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build it with 0402 components anyways</li>
<li>Use this as an opportunity to learn how to order pcbs / fr4 panels from a pcb manufacturing service.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are viable options, but since Veils v2 hardware designs are released, I want to try ordering pcbs and panels for that instead of these. My original intention for building the v1 was to at least have VCAs in my system while I wait for v2.</p>
<p>All components other than the 0402 packages seem to be identical. I just have to try to fit the 0402 packages between the pads spaced for 0603. This will be a bit tricky because I have to figure out how much solder paste I have to apply for each pad to compensate for the spacing difference. Luckily, I have two to build.</p>
<p>2020-12-31 8:43 PM</p>
<p>Shortly after I realized I ordered wrong packages for the build, I had to find something to control my frustration. The blemish panels for Veils was giving me bad vibes and I didn't want to look at them again. </p>
<p>So I grabbed a sanding disc and started peeling off the anodization and silk screen. After a few angry passes and then some with a finer grit, it looked pretty good. Not a perfect finish but miles better than looking at a b-stock panel.</p>

<p>The components arrived. 0402 components are... way too small.
I'll wait until the weekend to try building one of the veils.</p>
<p>Looks like the 0603 adapted pads have just enough space to fit a 0402 components between them, so it's definitely possible to use the original size.</p>
<p>I tried picking one of the resistors up with a tweezer and to my surprise, I think the static makes it stick to the tweezers. I guess they aren't ESD like they are advertized?
I always clean them with IPA so it's not sticking onto the residual flux for sure.</p>

<p>2021-01-09 9:12 PM</p>
<ul>
<li>soldered all through-hole components after checking for shorts</li>
<li>tested each channels individually for functionality before soldering. worked fine</li>
</ul>
<p>2021-01-10 2:14 AM</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual channels worked fine but daisy chaining was a bit wonky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After hours of troubleshooting with a few friends, narrowed it down to a problem occuring between the cascade mixing of channel 2 and channel 3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, channels 3 and 4's outputs were weaker and inverted.
<img src="/assets/images/2021-01-10-02-18-51.png">
<em>channel 2, 3, 4 output signal should be identical to channel 1's output signal, but channel 3 and 4's output are inverted and weak (dim and green)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After many solder joint touch-ups, identified IC4's pins 8 and/or 9 were the culprit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was happening, was the 2 OPAMPs between channels 2 and 3 were inverting the signal twice while gain staging, and the second OPAMP had a faulty solder joint. which lead to the signal not inverting back, and also going through a nearby resistor which made it weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working as intended now</p>

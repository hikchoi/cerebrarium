# Daily Journaling

## Pen & Paper vs. Digital
> Only take notes digitally when the content of the note needs to persist later on for any kind of knowledge work.

- I mainly use my pocket notebook for daily tasks that are not related to knowledge work.
  - They are still relevant and important to me. However, once they have served their purpose I do not care to get back to them.
  - It is important that these tasks are on a physical note that I can carry around because of it's _immediacy_.
    - I don't really care what I did yesterday, but I need to be sure that I can take a quick look at it without the hassle of pulling out my phone, clicking a button, navigating to today's journal, etc.
  - e.g.)
    - Go for a run.
    - Groceries.
    - Vacuum & Mop.
    - Order coffee beans.
- Note and tasks for knowledge work (both professional and personal) needs to be something that I can look up later and keep track.
  - Notes can change.
  - I need notes to persist so that I can make connections later.
  - I don't take persistant notes when I'm on the go.
  - If I need to be reminded that I need to do knowledge work, I will do so on a physical note.
    - However, the specifics of what I need to do for that would be written in this hierarchy of notes digitally.

## Workflow
1. Make a wikilink to a note of interest.
1. Below the wikilink, add tasks you want to achieve that day regarding the content of that note.
1. Linearly take notes and log your thoughts.
1. Once a pattern emerges, start refactoring these thoughts into their own notes.
  - Not all thoughts you write down needs to become a note. Do not force yourself.
  - This is essentially following the [[Ameoba pattern|cerebrarium.pkm.ameoba]]

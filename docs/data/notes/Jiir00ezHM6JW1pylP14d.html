<ul>
<li>Art is exquisitely responsive.</li>
<li>In art, it is more nourishing to be a maker than a viewer.</li>
<li>Decisive works of art participate directly in the fabric of history surrounding their maker.
<ul>
<li>You can't learn much about making that particular piece by being moved by it, as the creation is bound to the moment and location of where it happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If for any given time only a certain sort of work resonates with life, that is what you should be doing in that moment.</li>
<li>This is especially true now that art has been divorced from being a community effort and more close to the artist themselves.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is extremely common to encounter work not unfolding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may think that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you've run out of new ideas, or</li>
<li>you've been following a wrong path that leads to a dead end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if it was working before and it isn't now, neither could be the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New ideas come into play far less frequently than practical ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you did got you here, and if you apply the method again, you will get to the same place.</p>
<ul>
<li>If something was working and now it's not, your method has changed somewhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain tools make certain results possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dilemma: 
<ul>
<li>When to stick with familiar tools and materials</li>
<li>When to reach out and embrace new things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don't think about how or why we do things the way we do it. We just do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially when things are going well.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Once you discover a useful form of work, it should not be abandoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making good art depends on making <em>lots</em> of art, and anything that lets you do put the first brushstroke onto the canvas has a very real, tangible and practical value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the maker has a chance of knowing how important these minutiae and rituals are to them to stay at work.</li>
<li>These can be uninteresting to the viewers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hard part is finding these patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, a productive artist will have amassed these small patterns that makes them keep churning out work.</p>
<ul>
<li>As time goes by, these patterns go beyond simple procedure and gives the artist's work their own color.
<ul>
<li>It becomes inseparable from the artist.</li>
<li>At this point, the particularity of individual work becomes less of an issue.</li>

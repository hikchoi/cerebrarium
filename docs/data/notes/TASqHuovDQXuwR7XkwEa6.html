<p><a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB">Rule 1</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ritualize</p>
<ul>
<li>things to consider: 
<ul>
<li>Where</li>
<li>When</li>
<li>How you will work</li>
<li>What to do before</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I will mostly bound to do deep work in front of my computer as I am a software engineer.
<ul>
<li>I will be free to be wherever I want if I get a laptop. However having a large screen and a proper ergonomic setup for long hours of coding is something that cannot be emulated in an ad-hoc fashion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My work hours are non-linear and selective, meaning that I am free to change how my day is structured as long as I am present around my core working hours.
<ul>
<li>Given that I am rested well, I am most energetic an hour into my day.</li>
<li>I typically aim to wake up before 6AM, so starting at 7AM will be ideal.</li>
<li>Although my workday can be non-linear, I will initially try to stick to a near-linear work day until I am comfortable with the flow of it.</li>
<li>I will initially assume that I can maintain my concentration for a generous 4 hours of my day, so my deep work hours will be 7AM to 11AM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before going into my deep work session, I will lay out the problem I am trying to solve, and set up a goal for that session. Ideally, this will have already been done the previous day before work ends.</li>
<li>Before starting my deep work session, I need to make sure the following.
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> I have showered.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> My desk is clean.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> I have a cup of coffee and a light breakfast ready.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> I have my personal, non-work related daily tasks laid out in my journal.
<ul>
<li>This is to have a peace of mind that I have the rest of the day scheduled out outside my work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be Lazy</p>
<ul>
<li>For the sake of physical health, I will allocate 5 minutes every hour of my deep work session to stretch and do a light workout.</li>
<li>At the end of my work day, I will do the following sequence to give myself closure for the day.
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> finish off daily journal.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> Carry over unfinished tasks and plans to next day's journal.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> Close all tabs and programs related to work and sync my workspace.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> Clean up my desk </li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> Check my (personal) daily journal to check what I have to do after work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/notes/QrrrazP0cSMlX5ng">Rule 2</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take breaks from focus.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a software developer removing distraction (especially the Internet) is a very tricky thing to do, as a lot of reference material needed for work is on the web.</li>
<li>Some things to consider.
<ul>
<li>Blocker apps like <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/">https://selfcontrolapp.com/</a>
<ul>
<li>a bit artificial, but may need something like this to begin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pre-emptively looking up references.
<ul>
<li>not very effective. you don't usually know what you need to look up beforehand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust yourself to be mindful of distractions and try to naturally build the mental capacity to concentrate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am not entirely sure how to go about this, but will try using blocker apps and see how it goes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work like teddy</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving myself a strict deadline is something that I have not been doing a lot. Will try to incorporate this idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>productive medidation</p>
<ul>
<li>I have already been doing this for my evening strolls, but not necessarily for well-defined problems I am trying to solve.</li>
<li>I would normally try to consume audiobooks or read articles and take quick notes in my phone.</li>
<li>Will try to use this time to solve problems instead of consuming external information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>memorize a deck of cards</p>
<ul>
<li>memorizing a deck of cards isn't something that particularly interests me, so I will have to figure out an activity that will push me to intensely focus.</li>
<li>What makes me focus?
<ul>
<li>Generally anything that sparks my interest at that moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It might be worth looking into a fixed activity to do that is repeatable for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/notes/QceJfxoeInxsLwOKqzSFw">Rule 3</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram
<ul>
<li>I keep checking them, but I am not very active.</li>
<li>Simply reducing the frequency and time using it would work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reddit
<ul>
<li>Time sink, but not active in it myself.</li>
<li>Not gaining much value from looking at it most of the time.</li>
<li>Putting on an audio book could subsitute this and probably be immensely more valuable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Youtube
<ul>
<li>Main time sink, but I do gain a lot from non-leisurely consumption of videos.</li>
<li>Try to be mindful of what you decide to watch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/notes/KBOtk_bkpEGbeIMoGioL3">Rule 4</a></p>
<ul>
<li>schedule every minute of your day
<ul>
<li>this could be implemented in my pocket notebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/notes/A7hSbAhUOc08_-hYRh1EC">2021-06-29</a> and this note</p>
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li>I have gone through the reading notes of <a href="/notes/GubAN8JRkCVLNRBsX_5e4">deep work</a> and extracted actions that I can immediately take.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> take these and compile into a separate note that you can reference for any deep work related activities.</li>
</ul>

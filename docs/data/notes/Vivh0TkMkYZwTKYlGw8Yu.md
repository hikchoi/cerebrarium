**Digital ZettelKasten: Principles, Methods, and Examples**

## Notes
- The purpose of Zettelkasten is to explore the connection between notes. 
- Zettelkasten helps you ship writings.
    - It helps you to:
        1. retain what you read
        1. retrieve it quickly
        1. know what to read next
        1. develop your ideas
    - But ultimately the goal is to produce a piece of writing at the end.
- You can still read for pleasure without writing notes. Don't think you need to write notes and highlight things for every piece of article or books you read.
    - Only do it for things you do want to retain and use for your purpose later.
- It's not useless to write things down word-for-word if you want is exactly that: to refer to the exact text later.
- Otherwise, it is better to process that into your own words.
    - re-writing it involves actively thinking about it, and this fires a different part of your brain.
    - it leverages your brain's power to associate a piece of knowledge with other existing ideas.
- Using Google to substitue your memory and using a Zettelkasten is different.
    - The association does not happen in your brain.
- Using a a pen and paper could have benefits.
    - Research shows that writing by hand improves retention.
- In fleeting notes, you need to record enough of the context so that when you access it later to turn that into a literature note, you can recall what you were thinking when you were reading it.
- Choosing the right keyword allows you to explore your Zettelkasten effectively.
- Archivist's mind and writer's mind pick keywords differently
    - archivist: how do I choose a keyword so that I can retrieve this easily without second guessing?
    - writers: how do I choose a keyword so that it's useful in writing later?
- Try choosing keywords that are _specific to an idea_.
- Links or tags? They serve similar purposes.
- highlighting the highlights -> "progressive summarization" (Tiago Forte)

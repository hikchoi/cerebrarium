<p>Yesterday was a bit of a lackluster start of my precious weekend, so I think today could be a perfect time to reflect on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturday brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Woke up later than I wanted to, it was already hot outside and I woke up not being refreshed, but because it was too hot to stay in bed.</li>
<li>Made breakfast, got some chores out of my way.</li>
<li>Went for a walk, but it was not a good day to be outside (especially around noon).</li>
<li>Came back home and read a book for about 2 hours, but I fell asleep for about 45 minutes, because I didn't get enough sleep to begin with.</li>
<li>Made dinner. Completely messed up my dish (failed attempt at sea bass steak), felt pretty shitty and decided I am ordering takeout instead.</li>
<li>I usually cook for myself, so anything takeout would be a bit too heavy for me. This kinda knocked me out and I didn't have the willpower to get to what I wanted to work on today.</li>
<li>Went for a walk again, and this time it wasn't too bad.</li>
<li>Came back home, decided that today is not the day. Just killed time watching random youtube videos and got into bed.</li>
<li>Couldn't sleep because I had an unplanned nap and haven't been awake long enough to drain myself.</li>
<li>Stayed in bed for a few hours and got out at like 3AM.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Get your shit together</em></li>
<li>This seems to be the most frequent thing I write in my pocket notebook.</li>
<li>This is usually when I kinda need a reset on my sleep schedule and my energy.</li>
<li>Idea: templatize the getting-your-shit-together days for expedited get-your-shit-togethery.</li>
<li>Steps: 
<ul>
<li>Grab a big, but healthy meal. Something you are very familiar with and will fill you up.</li>
<li>Go for a walk. 20-30 minutes.</li>
<li>Take a shower.</li>
<li>Sit down and time-block the rest of your day.
<ul>
<li>Aim is to achieve minimum baseline productivity and then <em>one</em> small goal that will let you feel you have spent the rest of your day pretty well.
<ul>
<li>Get all chores done and read for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Get all chores done and draw something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go through shutdown routine and <em>make sure next day's journal is properly filled and time-blocked</em></li>
<li>If you still have energy or drive left to do something, continue on with the one task you did. Otherwise, wind down, do whatever.</li>
<li>Go to bed. Aim to get 7.5 hours of sleep.</li>
</ul>
</li>

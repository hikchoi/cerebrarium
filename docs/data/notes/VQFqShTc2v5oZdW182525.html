<ul>
<li>Buffer notes are notes used to temporarily store any content before it is moved to another place.</li>
<li>This is analogous to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer">data buffers</a>.</li>
<li>The main point of using the buffer note is to eliminate the friction of note taking by deferring the decision of note location or structure of the note from the note taking process that requires immediacy.</li>
<li>For the buffer note to be useful, the note taking tool needs to support a way to flush out the content of the note in its entirety, or partially to another location easily when later down the line you have decided where the content should go.</li>

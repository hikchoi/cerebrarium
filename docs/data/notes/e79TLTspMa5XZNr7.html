<p>"Everything starts from a dot." - Wassily Kandinsky</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Mathematically, a dot is a graphical illustration of a nildimensional space (a <em>point</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, you can't see it really.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, as a primitive building block of art, it's blob of ink (or any medium) that is small enough for the human eye to perceive as a single point in space (which you can see!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes a dot can be perceived not from explicitly marking a surface with a blob of ink but in relation of two <em>lines</em>. Two lines intersecting can create a dot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A row of dots arranged becomes a line when it's close enough for the human eye to not be able to perceive the gap between each successive dot.</p>

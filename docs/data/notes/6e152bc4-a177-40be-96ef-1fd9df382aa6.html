<p>This is the king of caudex (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Ever since I've discovered the wonderful world of caudiciforms, I've been drooling over the idea of obtaining a Pachypus.</p>
<p>This is a plant endemic to Madagascar, and is very tricky to root after importing.
The soil is removed and the roots and so-called <code>power tank</code> is cut to prevent the soils from entering the destination country.</p>
<p>Today (2021-02-27) I visited my <a href="https://www.goreplantseoul.com/">go-to store</a> for caudices to potentially purchase a small senna meridionalis (which I did), and the owner kindly offered me to pick up a unrooted, possibly dead Pachypus for free.</p>
<p>I figured I would dare try to root it and if I fail it still is an absolutely beasty looking plant so I could keep it as a trinket or decoration.</p>
<p>This is a tricky plant and not a lot of information is out there on the interent.
The most actively discussed place seems to be Japan, and I am now maniacally searching the web for japanese caudex blogs for 発根管理(root management) of pachypuses.</p>
<p>What I have gathered so far is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good draining soil.</li>
<li>Soak in root conditioner before potting.</li>
<li>Keep pot warm. mid 30 degrees celcius.</li>
<li>Water when soil just barely gets dry.</li>
<li>Spray HB-101 and the likes and water several times a day</li>
<li>Be patient and enjoy the ride.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be completely honest I have no expectation of successfully rooting this beast as even for fresh and well maintained imports the success rate is supposedly 10%</p>
<p>Since I am not confident in rooting a Pachypus (or even any plant in that matter), I would go with the advice of <a href="https://twelvedesign.jp/2019/07/05/operculicarya-pachypus-pet-bottle-1-2/">this post</a> and use a transparent pot to at least give me a visible indication of how the roots are doing.</p>
<p>Now I need to mix up a suitable well draining soil.
For this I am following the advice of <a href="https://inuairon.com/pachypodium-soil/">this post</a></p>
<p>For heating, I've considered wrapping the pot with a heated blanket, buying a sous-vide machine and submerging the pot, just having a heated blanket below the pot, etc.</p>
<p>the sous-vide machine method I now realize cannot be done as we cannot effectively drain the pot, and I'm scared of the humidity.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit scared of the fire hazard of wrapping the heated blanket AROUND the pot, as I think it's not meant to be bent while using.</p>
<p>I will have to use a heated blanket just under the pot and maybe wrap the pot with some heat retaining material so that the soil is evenly heated throughout the day.
I think they sell pads for pots but <a href="https://inuairon.com/pachypodium-rooting/">this post</a> shows me you can use a heating pad for reptiles. In <a href="https://codexgreen.com/unexplained-pachypus_purchase_3/">this post</a> they use a foot warmer.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I should soak the thing in root conditioner (like clone X or oxyberon) since it was already done by the shop owner. I'm going to go against my gut feeling and skip this as I don't know the effect of doing this repeatedly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchased all materials needed for mixing the soil, heating the pot, as well as a plastic.</li>

<li><a href="https://codexgreen.com/">codexgreen</a> logs the journey of rooting 4 pachypuses. This is very interesting. Out of the 4, they managed to succeed 3 times. second one being the failure. It is a very detailed log for root managing the plant.</li>
<li>I have a very dangerous feeling that I'll be sucked into this more deeply... The glorious feeling of successfully rooting a Pachypus and then seeing fresh leaves sprouting is something I want to experience myself.</li>
<li>The only thing that holds me back is the sheer cost and risk. It seems like starting with a healthy, strong stock is vital for success, and this means getting a larger stock that can survive the stress while importing / rooting. This also means that I will have to shell out a big chunk of money to source this, which I am currently not ready to do.</li>
<li>My best bet is to pretend what I currently have in hand has a possibility to survive, and to try out the seedlings.</li>

<li>Quite a bit of time has past since I started looking into pachypuses (pachypi?), but along the way I decided there is no way this is going to survive so I just left it as is.</li>
<li>However, I did purchase a very small and not-tubular pachypus for a relatively cheap.
<ul>
<li>It is currently getting used to the environment and has several bits where the new leaves are about to form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, apparently there will be a bulk sale of yet-to-be-rooted pachypuses at a new store.</li>
<li>So now I'm coming back to the topic and trying to gather information so I can be prepared to try out rooting it myself.</li>

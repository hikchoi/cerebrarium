<li>
<p>This is my primary goal for keeping my digital garden.</p>
<ul>
<li>To organize my thoughts and extract immediately actionable items out of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I usually have very big ideas and not enough momentum to deliver or act accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic debate of what drives people to do stuff:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's motivation that does this.</li>
<li>It's discipline.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Being motivated</em> seems to be the more romanticized choice for people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Having discipline</em> is taxing. It's dreadful and boring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nowadays I tend to believe that motivation does not end up with action. I have proved by brainwashing myself with motivational videos, thoughts and books multiple times and still not picking up my pen throughout my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe and been telling myself and others that discipline is what really drives action, but I don't seem to be disciplining myself that much.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>One bit of fact that I've heard somewhere is that <a href="/notes/qxHBIrIFTusEFRnUwQ73Z">anxiety</a> keeps you from tasks that need considerable commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do feel like I have to dissect this properly starting with a proper definition of <a href="/notes/BosW3RrhI5lWsUZ4">motivation</a>, <a href="/notes/T8UvA9uK1E75nW1U">discipline</a>, and the likes because they are all somewhat interchangeable in a sentence if I don't.</p>
</li>

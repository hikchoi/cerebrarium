  - Anxiety and stress is our brains capacity to predict danger.
    - An opportunity to look into to the future and be prepared for the possible outcomes.
    - Usually focused on negative consequences.
  - It exists for a reason. It gives us the ability to avoid them.

  - Anxiety involves _you_.
    - Consequences _you_ are anticipating to happen, and the preventative actions _you_ may or may not take.
    - Insecurities.

  - Anxiety is a future-focused mind.
    - Some people may think they are worried about something that they did / happened in the past, but what they are doing is they are looking at the event that happened in the past and projecting the consequences into the future.

  - Since anxiety is the ability to make predictions, the more you are capable of predicting what is going to happen, the worse your anxiety is.

  - Response to anxiety.

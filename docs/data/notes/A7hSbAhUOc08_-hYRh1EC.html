<p>Deep work resonated with me deeply. I will try to internalize this way of working both professionally and personally.</p>

<p><a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB">Rule 1</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I need to come up with v1 of my own <em>Eudaimonia Machine</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depth philosophy</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB#^Fop4AVPo">Monastic</a> approach is near impossible for me to implement.</li>
<li>The <a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB#^2zHHwu66">Bimodal</a> approach is something I can partially implement.
<ul>
<li>I can dedicate a day out of my weekends to do deep work for a set amount of time on my non-professional endeavors.</li>
<li>During the week, I will be spending time in a deep work state for my professional work.
<ul>
<li>Since <a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB#^Y0Ql_XBV">my willpower is limited</a>, it might not be a good idea to schedule a non-professional deep work session any day during the week.</li>
<li>This could change if I don't keep a distinction between my professional work and my personal work since there are quite a few overlaps between them. However, some personal work is just worth separating from work...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB#^Gqkgruf8">Rhythmic</a> approach seems like the most sane solution for my professional work.</li>
<li>As the author suggests, the <a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB#^tdNLbh_j">Journalistic</a> approach is not something for a novice deep worker.
<ul>
<li>I may come back to this later when I have successfully internalized other aspects of deep work, but for now this is beyond my ability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Dedicate enough time during the weekends for deep work sessions on your personal endeavors. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the week, make it a habit of rhythmically doing deep work during work.</p>

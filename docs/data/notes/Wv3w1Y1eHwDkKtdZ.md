- This is my primary goal for keeping my digital garden.
  - To organize my thoughts and extract immediately actionable items out of it.

- I usually have very big ideas and not enough momentum to deliver or act accordingly.
- Classic debate of what drives people to do stuff:
  1. It's motivation that does this.
  2. It's discipline.

- _Being motivated_ seems to be the more romanticized choice for people.
- _Having discipline_ is taxing. It's dreadful and boring.

- Nowadays I tend to believe that motivation does not end up with action. I have proved by brainwashing myself with motivational videos, thoughts and books multiple times and still not picking up my pen throughout my life.
- I believe and been telling myself and others that discipline is what really drives action, but I don't seem to be disciplining myself that much.

- One bit of fact that I've heard somewhere is that [[anxiety|cerebrarium.self.anxiety]] keeps you from tasks that need considerable commitment.

- I do feel like I have to dissect this properly starting with a proper definition of [[motivation|cerebrarium.self.motivation]], [[discipline|cerebrarium.self.discipline]], and the likes because they are all somewhat interchangeable in a sentence if I don't.

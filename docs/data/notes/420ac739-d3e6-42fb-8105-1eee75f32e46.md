# Inbox

> A giant dumping ground where I put all the things I want to save but don't have time to give a proper hierarchy.
> I try to leave a simple note on each inbox item so you have a context to work with when you get to it later.
> These notes do not persist. Once they are acted upon, it will have served it's purpose and it will be deleted.

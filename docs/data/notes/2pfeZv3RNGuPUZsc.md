- When is the best time to focus on personal interests on weekdays?
  - Some patterns to think about:
    - Continuous focused session for my personal interests in the morning.
    - Work in the morning, personal stuff in early afternoon, finish off work in the evening.
    - Start work early and and finish early. Have the rest of the night for yourself.
  - Even though I love what I do for work, it is still an obligation for me and deferring my obligations is something that I don't seem to be able to handle.
    - Mentally, having work done for the day gives me a better separation between work and life.
    - Related to the concept of strictly [[shutting down|ext.deep-work.rule-1#^HnqIEqCAMwE8MZ92]] so that your brain can off load the burden of thinking about work.
    - What makes this hard for me is that most of the zoom calls are scheduled to be very late at night due to timezone differences.

- Personal stuff in the morning, work for the rest of the day.
  - This is good because I am prioritizing my personal life.
  - Deferring obligations is anxiety inducing.
  - Naturally takes care of the fragmented working hours; I can just work late in the evening and attend late meetings in a continuous session without fragmenting my working hours.
  - For my personal sessions, this is a good way because it gives me a hard deadline for my personal stuff. A sense of urgency with what I care about.
    - Less likely to slack off.

- Work early in the day, finish early and go into personal sessions after a shutdown routine.
  - Going into personal stuff after having all my obligations met for the day is complete bliss.
    - Related to motivation
      - Incremental growth through persistance and discipline seems better.
  - This however gives me a less sense of urgency with my personal sessions.
  - Late meetings are fragmented and I need to either 
    1. learn how to deal with that fragmentation, or 
    2. ask to move the schedule.

- Weaving in personal stuff throughout the day while you work.
  - This is complete chaos.
  - Context switching is expensive.
  - Can't keep it simple.

- [[art log|cerebrarium.art.log]]
  - I am using this hierarchy to dump all my logs for making art.
  - Need to find a way to shelve them once I amassed enough logs.
  - For now, just append to the end of the log.

- [[proj.HANDS]]
  - left hand (L), right hand (R)
  - 5 digits to mark which fingers are folded(0) or not(1)
    - first digit after L/R is the thumb, and the rest follows.
  - e.g. left hand, fist: L00000

- [[proj]]
  - having a `.do` `.done` `.backlog` hierarchy doesn't feel that intuitive.
    - While refactoring is easy, having them indexed in the parent note is easier.
  - [x] flatten out project hierarchy.
  - [x] make index of project status in the parent note.

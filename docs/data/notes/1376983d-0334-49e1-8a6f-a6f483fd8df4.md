## Notes
- My [personal website](https://markhyunikchoi.com) is slightly abandoned because my [[cerebrarium]] has overtaken most of my interests.
- This is still something I want to tend to though.
- Currently I don't have the bandwidth to do so, but I need to at least update my [now page](https://markhyunikchoi.com/now/).
    - keeping this in the backlog and just doing the now page is a sensible option for now.

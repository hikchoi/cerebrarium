<ul>
<li>References and cheatsheets.
<ul>
<li>Notes that are strictly instructional and give reference to things that I look up on the internet a lot.</li>
<li>There aren't a lot of abstract thinking going on here, so it might be a good idea to keep this separate from <a href="/notes/919a3a68-d78d-4403-aca5-ea6e722ca35b">Cerebrarium</a> and reduce the noise there.</li>
<li>These are also different from what <a href="/notes/Y_H6rBwXIinOO1QtrsNLV">External Information</a> hierarchy has because I am not really <em>actively consuming</em> the content of these. I am simply noting them for later reference.</li>
<li>This hierarchy can use a lot of schemas and will be more hierarchy-heavy than link-heavy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actionables:
<ul>
<li>start <code>ref.*</code> hierarchy.</li>
<li>sort out all ref notes in vault and refactor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Embrace Boredom</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to concentrate is something you need to train.
<ul>
<li>It's not something you know is good but you are simply neglecting. You need to build the mental muscle to properly concentrate.</li>
<li>You also need to wean off the distractions around your life at the same time.</li>
<li>Clifford Nass
<ul>
<li><em>People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If every moment of boredom is relieved with a dose of quick and immediate gratification (e.g. distractions like social media), your mind will be wired to seek those even in times where you need to get in to deep work state.</li>

Instead Take Breaks from Focus.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once you are wired to seek distraction, you will crave it.
<ul>
<li>Some people go on Internet Sabbaths (digital detoxes) to <em>take a break from distraction</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of doing this, turn it around and <em>schedule breaks from focus</em>, where you are allowed to be distracted.
<ul>
<li>Segregate blocks of times you are allowed to use the Internet.</li>
<li>You are strengthening the muscle that seeks focus instead of the ones that seek distraction by doing so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>This strategy works even in your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.
<ul>
<li>If your work <em>needs</em> the internet, you simply allocate blocks more frequently.</li>
<li>The number or duration of blocks don't matter as long as you keep the integrity of <em>off time</em> in tact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.
<ul>
<li>What if you forgot to pull in everything you need from the internet while you are in an offline block?
<ul>
<li>Immediately rescheduling and going back to the internet is not the way.</li>
<li>Try to find another offline activity that needs your focus.</li>
<li>If that doesn't work, try to resist going back to the internet to get what you need because the point of doing this is to condition your mental muscle to seek focus. Resistance will build that muscle for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.
<ul>
<li>Train yourself to resist getting sucked into distractions even after work to further strengthen your mental muscle to seek focus.</li>
<li>Embracing the boredom while waiting in line, etc. is valuable.
<ul>
<li>Again conditioning yourself to not immediately reach for the quick release of dopamine.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Identify a deep task.</li>
<li>Put it high on your priority.</li>
<li>Estimate how long you would normally give this task.</li>
<li>Give yourself a hard deadline that will significantly reduce the time you would normally allocate to it.</li>
<li>Work with great intensely to fit that task within the deadline.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a.k.a the <em>Roosevelt Dashes</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is great because this method is incompatible with distraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't afford to be distracted in this situation.</li>

<ul>
<li>Productive meditation
<ul>
<li>Take a period of time where you would be occupied in a physically but not mentally draining task.</li>
<li>Focus your attention to a single well-defined problem you are trying to solve during this time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This has a benefit of naturally resisting distraction in period of time where your brain will otherwise be idle (because your task is only phsycially demanding).</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Be Wary of Distractions and Looping
<ul>
<li>When you find yourself drifting away from your problem, remind yourself gently and get back to it.</li>
<li>Looping
<ul>
<li>When faced with a complex problem you may get stuck spending energy thinking about what you already know about.</li>
<li>Make note that you are in a loop, and think of the next steps to take in order to get out of that loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structure Your Deep Thinking
<ul>
<li>Carefully think about the variables involved in solving this problem.</li>
<li>Once you have them in your mind, figure out the next step to take after consolidating your findings.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Memorizing requires immense focus.</li>
<li>It's not about memorizing for the sake of memorizing something.
<ul>
<li>It is about focusing on something intensely to grow your muscles for concentration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is nothing special about memorizing a deck of cards. If that doesn't make sense, find something else that needs intense focus.
<ul>
<li>e.g.) Studying the Talmud. Trying to learn guitar by ear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it.</li>

- Creating (visual) art can seem like a pretty intuitive and impromptu task, but in reality there are a lot of similarities between visual art and writing. 
  - Like writing, there is a whole spectrum of artist that on one end start a drawing from a blank paper and goes by their gut feeling, and on the other end, meticulously build up their visual libraries and accumulate studies on various topics until they reach to their final goal.
- In the end, both are creative processes.

- It would be interesting to see how the pkm tools can be adapted for people in the visual art world.

## Art and Fear

- Those who continue to make art are the ones who learned _how to not quit_.
  - Artists quit when 
    - they convince themselves that their next effort will fail them.
    - they lose where their work belongs / lose their destination.
- _the pen has run dry_ / artist's block / etc.
  - It means it's time to cultivate new ideas, but in artistic death, it means it's the last thing an artist will do.
- Quitting means not starting again, but art is all about starting again. ^QgLc00UDcxI2

- Another case: reaching their destination.
  - Success turns into depression.
  - Don't let you current goal become your only goal.
    - Always leave next steps and think about your next destination.

- _OPERATING MANUAL FOR NOT QUITTING_
  - Make friends with others who make art, and share your in-progress work with each other frequently. ^beDUjUvSguJQ
  - Think of the above as the destination of your work, not MoMA.

- The fear that naturally comes to people who get the sense of self from making art
  - I am not up to the task, I can't do it / do it well, can't do it again, I have no talent, I am not a good artist, I have nothing to say.

- These fear has less to do with art itself, it's more about the artist. Even less with each art piece.
- What separates artists from ex-artists is that those who challenge their fears continue, and those who don't, quit.

### Vision and Execution
- Vision is always ahead of execution (it should).
- Knowledge of materials is your contact with reality.
- Uncertainty is a virtue.
  - When you see that self-doubt is a simple observation of reality, uncertainty becomes an asset.

### Imagination
- The artwork's potential is highest on the first brushstroke, and will naturally diminish. Imagination becomes less useful as the skill / craft takes over.

- The development of an imagined piece into an actual piece is a progression of decreasing possibilities.
  - Each step reduces the future options.
  - When the piece could not be other than it is, it is done.

- The moment of completion is the moment of loss
  - of all other forms of that piece that could have been.

- The artist's life is frustrating not because the passage is slow, but because they imagine it to be fast.

### Materials
- Without you as an artist participating in turning the potential into reality, the material will stay there indifferently. They will do precisely what you make them to do.

- _The painter who stands before an empty canvas must think in terms of paint_.
- Knowledge of how the material responses and resists will suggest new ideas to you.
- Art is about carrying things out, and the material is what _can_ be carried out.

### Uncertainty
- Other than the material you are using, most if not all other aspects of art is filled with uncertainty.
- You need to give yourself room to respond to this uncertainty authentically.
  - Art happens between _you_ and _something_, and both need to be free to move around.
- Art is risky, subversive, complicated, etc.
  - People who need certainty are less likely to make art.
- What an artist needs
  - general sense of what they are looking for
  - a strategy to find it
  - and willing to accept the mistakes and surprises along the way.
- Tolerance to uncertainty is needed.

<ul>
<li>
<p>Those who continue to make art are the ones who learned <em>how to not quit</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Artists quit when 
<ul>
<li>they convince themselves that their next effort will fail them.</li>
<li>they lose where their work belongs / lose their destination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>the pen has run dry</em> / artist's block / etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>It means it's time to cultivate new ideas, but in artistic death, it means it's the last thing an artist will do.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Another case: reaching their destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success turns into depression.</li>
<li>Don't let you current goal become your only goal.
<ul>
<li>Always leave next steps and think about your next destination.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Think of the above as the destination of your work, not MoMA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fear that naturally comes to people who get the sense of self from making art</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not up to the task, I can't do it / do it well, can't do it again, I have no talent, I am not a good artist, I have nothing to say.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These fear has less to do with art itself, it's more about the artist. Even less with each art piece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What separates artists from ex-artists is that those who challenge their fears continue, and those who don't, quit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Vision is always ahead of execution (it should).</li>
<li>Knowledge of materials is your contact with reality.</li>
<li>Uncertainty is a virtue.
<ul>
<li>When you see that self-doubt is a simple observation of reality, uncertainty becomes an asset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="imagination"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#imagination"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Imagination</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The artwork's potential is highest on the first brushstroke, and will naturally diminish. Imagination becomes less useful as the skill / craft takes over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of an imagined piece into an actual piece is a progression of decreasing possibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each step reduces the future options.</li>
<li>When the piece could not be other than it is, it is done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moment of completion is the moment of loss</p>
<ul>
<li>of all other forms of that piece that could have been.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The artist's life is frustrating not because the passage is slow, but because they imagine it to be fast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#materials"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Without you as an artist participating in turning the potential into reality, the material will stay there indifferently. They will do precisely what you make them to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The painter who stands before an empty canvas must think in terms of paint</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of how the material responses and resists will suggest new ideas to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art is about carrying things out, and the material is what <em>can</em> be carried out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uncertainty"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#uncertainty"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
<li>Other than the material you are using, most if not all other aspects of art is filled with uncertainty.</li>
<li>You need to give yourself room to respond to this uncertainty authentically.
<ul>
<li>Art happens between <em>you</em> and <em>something</em>, and both need to be free to move around.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Art is risky, subversive, complicated, etc.
<ul>
<li>People who need certainty are less likely to make art.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What an artist needs
<ul>
<li>general sense of what they are looking for</li>
<li>a strategy to find it</li>
<li>and willing to accept the mistakes and surprises along the way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tolerance to uncertainty is needed.</li>
</ul>

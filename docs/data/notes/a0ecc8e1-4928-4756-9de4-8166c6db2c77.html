<ul>
<li>Stumbled upon <a href="https://betterhumans.pub/draft-how-to-hack-your-brain-to-achieve-consistency-that-lasts-7f5fdc520d28">this</a> the other day</li>
<li>It talks about the UI/UX of a analog habit tracking dashboard.</li>
<li>I lack the way to track my habits in my current journaling setup and this looks something worth experimenting.</li>

<ul>
<li>I never started this. Life got in my way.</li>
<li>I probably should have done it back then when life was getting in my way in retrospect.</li>
<li>This does look like something that can go along with <a href="/notes/GubAN8JRkCVLNRBsX_5e4">deep work</a>, so I should do this soon.</li>
<li>Let's keep this in our daily and carry over until it's done.
<ul>
<li>Giving myself a week to implement and start using it.</li>

<li>Thoughts while taking notes on <a href="/notes/GNor0QXSFmdgyEt4">Minimalist Journaling</a>
<ul>
<li>It's easy to fall into the trap of continuously seeking for motivation on the Internet: binge watching talks, podcasts, etc. when you feel like you are not progressing towards your goal.
<ul>
<li>This is the comfort zone you want to be in: having the possibility of improving and continuously feeding yourself external motivation. Feeling optimistic about your goals but not executing / acting upon it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The OS / UI analogy is interesting.</li>
<li>When it goes into the method, I lost interest. It's just another person's way to keep their habits.
<ul>
<li>It did look like the writer made it a fun system for them. Just not something I would do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawing a square for each day does make sense. The human mind apparently works well when information is organized spacially.</li>
<li>What I got out of this is simple:
<ul>
<li>The visually appealing aspect of this method made it a fun thing to do for the writer. My way of tracking habits may not have to be this detailed, but I can definitely make it more fun and visually appealing in my notebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2021-07-10 21:32</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know what I expected going into this. Ultimately everyone's method is different and I may have thought the visual aspect of this would imply that this method is great. I got some insights out of this but I most likely won't implement this to a tee.</li>

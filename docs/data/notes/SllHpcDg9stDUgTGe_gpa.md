# Being Present

- Stillness in thought, fully observing what is here and now.
- Focusing on what is currently happening both internally and externally.

- [[Anxiety|cerebrarium.self.anxiety]] is not possible if you focus on being present, because anxiety is an anticipation of the future, the anticipation that the future will not be favorable to you, unpleasant, or sad.

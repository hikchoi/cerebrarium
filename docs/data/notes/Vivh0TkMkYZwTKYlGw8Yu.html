<ul>
<li>The purpose of Zettelkasten is to explore the connection between notes. </li>
<li>Zettelkasten helps you ship writings.
<ul>
<li>It helps you to:
<ol>
<li>retain what you read</li>
<li>retrieve it quickly</li>
<li>know what to read next</li>
<li>develop your ideas</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>But ultimately the goal is to produce a piece of writing at the end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can still read for pleasure without writing notes. Don't think you need to write notes and highlight things for every piece of article or books you read.
<ul>
<li>Only do it for things you do want to retain and use for your purpose later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's not useless to write things down word-for-word if you want is exactly that: to refer to the exact text later.</li>
<li>Otherwise, it is better to process that into your own words.
<ul>
<li>re-writing it involves actively thinking about it, and this fires a different part of your brain.</li>
<li>it leverages your brain's power to associate a piece of knowledge with other existing ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using Google to substitue your memory and using a Zettelkasten is different.
<ul>
<li>The association does not happen in your brain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using a a pen and paper could have benefits.
<ul>
<li>Research shows that writing by hand improves retention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In fleeting notes, you need to record enough of the context so that when you access it later to turn that into a literature note, you can recall what you were thinking when you were reading it.</li>
<li>Choosing the right keyword allows you to explore your Zettelkasten effectively.</li>
<li>Archivist's mind and writer's mind pick keywords differently
<ul>
<li>archivist: how do I choose a keyword so that I can retrieve this easily without second guessing?</li>
<li>writers: how do I choose a keyword so that it's useful in writing later?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try choosing keywords that are <em>specific to an idea</em>.</li>
<li>Links or tags? They serve similar purposes.</li>
<li>highlighting the highlights -> "progressive summarization" (Tiago Forte)</li>
</ul>

<li>You need to define your target audience.
<ul>
<li>and close you are with them.</li>
<li>you need to make sure that the feedback you get from dogfooding is in line with what the users are thinking.
<ul>
<li>otherwise you are risking building a tool that fits your team, but not the end users.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Your team is a lot more familiar with your app than your customers are.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>it is natural for your team to be biased towards the app</li>
<li>dogfooding is great but it's not a replacement for proper QA testing.</li>
<li>if your app does a very specific / specialized task and cannot be adapted to you, it is best to avoid dogfooding as it will likely give a false feedback.</li>
<li>doing it too early when the product is immature may backfire as well. In this case dogfooding could be more of an obstacle.</li>

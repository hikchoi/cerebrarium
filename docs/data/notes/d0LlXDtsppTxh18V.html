<ul>
<li>Taking notes on drawing was a great idea. This is already giving me more ideas (and the drive to execute it) more than anything else I tried with art the past 10 years.
<ul>
<li>A good precursor to <a href="/notes/20dP7mE5UPRsYQVK">exploring knowledge management for visual thinkers</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HANDS projects (name pending) is a great idea to practice and also would be a great excuse to order more stickers.</li>

<li>The idea of having a <em>working surface</em> that you can default to when taking notes was a simple but effective change that I internalized.
<ul>
<li><em>Having a working surface</em> means not having to worry about anything before jotting down your ideas.</li>
<li>These are all potentially expensive operations / blockers that require context switching from note taking:
<ul>
<li>Coming up with the name / title</li>
<li>Figuring out where the note belongs (heirarchy / folder)</li>
<li>The anxiety that comes from the possibility that this note is going to be lost in the void</li>
<li>Other notes begging for your attention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not something I invented.
<ul>
<li>Journal notes and scratch notes are exactly serving this purpose.
<ul>
<li>Maybe even having another buffer where my thoughts go could be a good separation as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I just haven't thought about it in a spacial metaphor.
<ul>
<li>I keep my desk where I work as clean as possible all the time so that I don't get distracted by other things.</li>
<li>It's a place that I can reliably come to sit down and work right away when I need to.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>buffer note 
<ul>
<li>is a single note that has a fixed location where you stage your immediate ideas.</li>
<li>it has one purpose: to hold the idea that you have right now.</li>
<li>you flush the content of your notes to appropriate places in your pkm.</li>
<li>it is different from scratch notes or transient notes as you are making a conscious decision to create a scratch note (usually in a context of a different note, for the purpose of linking to/from it); buffer notes will always be there, and you are deferring the decision of note creation (in the right place and context) to a later time.</li>
<li>it is different from journal notes because buffer notes are not temporally organized. it is a spacial distinction from the rest of your notes.</li>
<li>it is a singleton note that will always be there and will always be uniquely there.
<ul>
<li>scratch notes minus the ability to have multiples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>blockers
<ul>
<li>if you cannot for some reason flush out the content of the buffer, you won't be able to proceed.</li>
</ul>

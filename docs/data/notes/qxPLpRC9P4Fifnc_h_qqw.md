- Yesterday was a long day. Couldn't do much. Carrying over the items from yesterday to work on.

- [[proj]] Needs a bit of cleaning.
- As well as [[inbox]]
- Current main interest is [[art|cerebrarium.art]]. That hierarchy looks pretty lonely. Let's focus on making new branches there.

- my now page has been neglected for some time. I need to get to that.

- Cal Newport's [Time-Block Planner](https://www.timeblockplanner.com/) looks like it's a easy way to implement one of the ways to be mindful about deep work.
  - This is mentioned in [[Schedule Every Minute of Your Day|ext.deep-work.rule-4#schedule-every-minute-of-your-day]].
- I tried implementing this method on my pocket notebook (passport size), and it seems to be too small for it.
- The problem with Cal's product (my problem, not the product's problem) is that it's a separate note book, and I specifically need to use my pocket notebook. [[cerebrarium.pkm.pen-and-paper]]
- [Here](https://youtu.be/eff9h1WYxSo) is the instructions to use the Time-Block Planner.
  - Cal mentions that it's important to have this in a physical form (paper) so that you don't have to get on your computer when you don't need to.
- I think this is something I can implement if I'm willing to use the whole spread of the notebook and make the time blocks small enought that constant re-allocation doesn't fill up the day too fast.
- Actionables:
  - Start tomorrow's daily journal on an entire spread, and use the right side of the notebook for time blocking.
  - Do this for next week.
  - Retrospect on this matter next Sunday. [[daily.journal.2021.07.11]]

- Inbox retrospect
  - A bulk of my inbox items are "read this later".
  - The notes are pretty standard:
    - Title of the book / url of the article.
    - In what context did I run across this thing.
  - In the interest of not generating too many notes, I should keep one hierarchy [[inbox.reading]] to keep all of them in one place.
  - If it is an item that requires me to check out more than one source of information (or already has specific things I need to do for that), I will keep it as a separate note instead of in this list.

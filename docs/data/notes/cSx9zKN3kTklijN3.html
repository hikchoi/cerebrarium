<li>Did show me that being pedantic / deliberate with my drawing practice indeed pays off.</li>
<li>I think keeping this as a <em>default</em> thing to do for art would let me keep doing something and not worry about <em>what</em> to draw and stuff like that. things that really gives you the artist's block.</li>

<li>Currently reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733">Art &#x26; Fear</a> by David Bayles. Should probably start a reading note on it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Suprisingly illustrates perfectly what I was looking for.</li>
<li>I was very loosely doing what the video was talking about in my own stuff but the pipeline was never externalized for me.</li>
<li>Some ideas for new hierarchies:
<ul>
<li>a hierarchies of primitives. <code>cerebrarium.art.primitives</code></li>
<li>this is an entry point to structuralize everything i observe and try to draw.</li>
<li>simply putting in effort to practice drawing cubes and stuff would be already beneficial, but having a library of notes on what I learned in the process of practicing them would be good to have for the future to look up.</li>

<li>What should go into primitives?
<ul>
<li>probably start with a dot, then a line, then a shape, then volume.</li>

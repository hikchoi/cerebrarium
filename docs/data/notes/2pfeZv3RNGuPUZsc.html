<li>
<p>When is the best time to focus on personal interests on weekdays?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some patterns to think about:
<ul>
<li>Continuous focused session for my personal interests in the morning.</li>
<li>Work in the morning, personal stuff in early afternoon, finish off work in the evening.</li>
<li>Start work early and and finish early. Have the rest of the night for yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even though I love what I do for work, it is still an obligation for me and deferring my obligations is something that I don't seem to be able to handle.
<ul>
<li>Mentally, having work done for the day gives me a better separation between work and life.</li>
<li>Related to the concept of strictly <a href="/notes/qkk3MGMtlaWgEjRB#^HnqIEqCAMwE8MZ92">shutting down</a> so that your brain can off load the burden of thinking about work.</li>
<li>What makes this hard for me is that most of the zoom calls are scheduled to be very late at night due to timezone differences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal stuff in the morning, work for the rest of the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is good because I am prioritizing my personal life.</li>
<li>Deferring obligations is anxiety inducing.</li>
<li>Naturally takes care of the fragmented working hours; I can just work late in the evening and attend late meetings in a continuous session without fragmenting my working hours.</li>
<li>For my personal sessions, this is a good way because it gives me a hard deadline for my personal stuff. A sense of urgency with what I care about.
<ul>
<li>Less likely to slack off.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work early in the day, finish early and go into personal sessions after a shutdown routine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Going into personal stuff after having all my obligations met for the day is complete bliss.
<ul>
<li>Related to motivation
<ul>
<li>Incremental growth through persistance and discipline seems better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This however gives me a less sense of urgency with my personal sessions.</li>
<li>Late meetings are fragmented and I need to either 
<ol>
<li>learn how to deal with that fragmentation, or </li>
<li>ask to move the schedule.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weaving in personal stuff throughout the day while you work.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is complete chaos.</li>
<li>Context switching is expensive.</li>
<li>Can't keep it simple.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><a href="/notes/DCUwJEvVyqJubJOf">art log</a>
<ul>
<li>I am using this hierarchy to dump all my logs for making art.</li>
<li>Need to find a way to shelve them once I amassed enough logs.</li>
<li>For now, just append to the end of the log.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="/notes/OKoUvBr6PQa2yUHp">HANDS</a>
<ul>
<li>left hand (L), right hand (R)</li>
<li>5 digits to mark which fingers are folded(0) or not(1)
<ul>
<li>first digit after L/R is the thumb, and the rest follows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e.g. left hand, fist: L00000</li>

<li>having a <code>.do</code> <code>.done</code> <code>.backlog</code> hierarchy doesn't feel that intuitive.
<ul>
<li>While refactoring is easy, having them indexed in the parent note is easier.</li>

<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> flatten out project hierarchy.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> make index of project status in the parent note.</li>

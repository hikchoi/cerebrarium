<li>This is something that I gave myself until end of Q1 to get to a point where I can make prints for 2-3 finished pieces, but fell off for other things.</li>
<li>This is worth getting back to as art is currently something I am active trying to work on.</li>
<li>Let's get back to this during July and set out a plan to move this forward.</li>

<li><em>finishing</em>, or declaring a drawing / art project as <em>finished</em> is important not because it is pushing you out of your comfort zone / having discipline / drive or anything. It is important because it lets your mind to flush out the lingering doubts and worries that you had with your last piece and focus on other things. (which then leads to spending more quality time on things that will improve your skills or push you out of your comfort zone, etc.)
<ul>
<li>I guess the principle of <em>shutting down</em> talked about in <a href="/notes/GubAN8JRkCVLNRBsX_5e4">Deep Work</a> applies here as well, in a more generalized sense.</li>
<li>So while having concurrent projects could mean you are exploring various pathways, it also means that each of them are being a distraction.
<ul>
<li>At least it seems like this is the case for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>this is something that has been lingering around for a while just nagging me for attention. This should probably be fixed.
<ul>
<li>In the spirit of <a href="/notes/GubAN8JRkCVLNRBsX_5e4">Deep Work</a>, I should at least
<ul>
<li>Define a clear way of how to proceed when I decided to pick it back up, or</li>
<li>Get to actually working on it, until I have a tangible deliverable.
<ul>
<li>Incremental, but logically separated chunks of goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My original plan at the end of 2020 was to get 4-5 pieces done and go through actually printing them in small scale by Q1.</li>

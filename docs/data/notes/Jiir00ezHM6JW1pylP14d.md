## Finding Your Work
- Art is exquisitely responsive.
- In art, it is more nourishing to be a maker than a viewer.
- Decisive works of art participate directly in the fabric of history surrounding their maker.
  - You can't learn much about making that particular piece by being moved by it, as the creation is bound to the moment and location of where it happened.
- If for any given time only a certain sort of work resonates with life, that is what you should be doing in that moment.
- This is especially true now that art has been divorced from being a community effort and more close to the artist themselves.

### Canon
- It is extremely common to encounter work not unfolding.
- You may think that:
  - you've run out of new ideas, or
  - you've been following a wrong path that leads to a dead end.
- But if it was working before and it isn't now, neither could be the case.
- New ideas come into play far less frequently than practical ideas.
- What you did got you here, and if you apply the method again, you will get to the same place.
  - If something was working and now it's not, your method has changed somewhere.

- Certain tools make certain results possible.
  - The dilemma: 
    - When to stick with familiar tools and materials
    - When to reach out and embrace new things.
- We don't think about how or why we do things the way we do it. We just do.
  - Especially when things are going well.

- Working within the self-imposed discipline of a particular form eases the prospect of having to reinvent yourself with each new piece. ^n0zxPU5gvZMM
- Once you discover a useful form of work, it should not be abandoned.
- Making good art depends on making _lots_ of art, and anything that lets you do put the first brushstroke onto the canvas has a very real, tangible and practical value.
  - Only the maker has a chance of knowing how important these minutiae and rituals are to them to stay at work.
  - These can be uninteresting to the viewers.
- The hard part is finding these patterns.
- Over time, a productive artist will have amassed these small patterns that makes them keep churning out work.
  - As time goes by, these patterns go beyond simple procedure and gives the artist's work their own color.
    - It becomes inseparable from the artist.
    - At this point, the particularity of individual work becomes less of an issue.

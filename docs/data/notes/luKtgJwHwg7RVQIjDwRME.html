<ul>
<li>Doing something nobody might care whether you do, doing something that you might not get rewarded for.</li>

<ul>
<li>It's not a magical gift.</li>
<li>Being an artist means:
<ul>
<li>learning to accept yourself (makes your art personal)</li>
<li>follow your own voice (makes your art distinctive)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These qualities are clearly something that can be learned.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A flawless creature does not need to make art.</li>
<li>In turn, this means an ideal artist would be an ordinary person with all the flaws and weaknesses.</li>
<li>These are things that get in the way of making art, but it is what drives us to make art.</li>
<li>Making art has to do with overcoming these.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Making art gives you an accurate measure of what you intended to do and what you actually did.</li>
<li>To everyone else, what matters is the end product. To yourself, and you alone, the process is what matters.
<ul>
<li>Artmaking can be lonely and thankless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no good reason anyone else <em>should</em> care about any art other people make.
<ul>
<li>You learn <em>how to make your work</em> by <em>making your work</em>.</li>
<li>learning to make your own work is not anyone else's problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>People have been making art long before the concept of self, consciousness has entered humanity.</li>
<li>The notion of art being a <em>self-expression</em> is a rather contemporary concept.
<ul>
<li>If you make flawed art, does that make you a flawed person?</li>
<li>If you make no art at all, are you not a person at all?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is best to not get into the trap of this and think that art has many paths.</li>

Feeling optimistic about your goals but not executing / acting upon it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The OS / UI analogy is interesting.</li>\n<li>When it goes into the method, I lost interest. It's just another person's way to keep their habits.\n<ul>\n<li>It did look like the writer made it a fun system for them. Just not something I would do.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Drawing a square for each day does make sense. The human mind apparently works well when information is organized spacially.</li>\n<li>What I got out of this is simple:\n<ul>\n<li>The visually appealing aspect of this method made it a fun thing to do for the writer. My way of tracking habits may not have to be this detailed, but I can definitely make it more fun and visually appealing in my notebook.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-07-10 21:32</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't know what I expected going into this. Ultimately everyone's method is different and I may have thought the visual aspect of this would imply that this method is great. I got some insights out of this but I most likely won't implement this to a tee.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#backlinks\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Backlinks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/220ff743-4a40-4724-b4b2-f0a8d74dc46c\">Proj</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/qxPLpRC9P4Fifnc_h_qqw\">2021-07-04</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/PiWkMf8_aK-TI3h1foE9t\">2021-07-10</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"919a3a68-d78d-4403-aca5-ea6e722ca35b","title":"Cerebrarium","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"cerebrarium","id":"919a3a68-d78d-4403-aca5-ea6e722ca35b","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"cerebrarium.pkm.para","alias":"PARA","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":12,"offset":749},"end":{"line":15,"column":41,"offset":778},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"cerebrarium.pkm.para"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"cerebrarium","id":"919a3a68-d78d-4403-aca5-ea6e722ca35b","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"cerebrarium.pkm.zettelkasten","alias":"Zettelkasten","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":46,"offset":783},"end":{"line":15,"column":91,"offset":828},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"cerebrarium.pkm.zettelkasten"}},{"from":{"fname":"ext","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":40,"column":87,"offset":2834},"end":{"line":40,"column":102,"offset":2849},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"ext","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":99,"offset":3059},"end":{"line":42,"column":114,"offset":3074},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"inbox.do","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":31,"offset":157},"end":{"line":6,"column":46,"offset":172},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"proj.mhc-housekeeping","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":86,"offset":610},"end":{"line":23,"column":101,"offset":625},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"proj.set-up-para","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":46,"offset":86},"end":{"line":5,"column":61,"offset":101},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.07.06","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":19,"offset":1162},"end":{"line":23,"column":34,"offset":1177},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.07.06","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":30,"offset":1483},"end":{"line":26,"column":45,"offset":1498},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.07.06","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":31,"column":19,"offset":1886},"end":{"line":31,"column":34,"offset":1901},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.07.10","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":22,"offset":259},"end":{"line":7,"column":37,"offset":274},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.07.10","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":39,"offset":1347},"end":{"line":24,"column":54,"offset":1362},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.07.11","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":22,"offset":102},"end":{"line":4,"column":37,"offset":117},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"daily.journal.2021.08.03","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":114,"offset":270},"end":{"line":5,"column":129,"offset":285},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"}],"anchors":{"cerebrarium":{"type":"header","value":"cerebrarium","line":10,"column":0}},"fname":"cerebrarium","updated":1624778759593,"created":1608971683570,"parent":null,"children":["f52825ef-7efe-4373-9784-255b9a058deb","815d5e1b-44ea-476a-868d-5fada4342924","65cb4031-d3d3-4e1a-a295-b96693df9d52","fc872c52-b139-4f32-80d5-9fcf05b41621","Jytev4B6USaFF48P","e6765163-38b4-42eb-a122-0d8ccca6ae22","ZtihdRyqFJMCdlVjMPuZj"],"data":{},"contentHash":"2aec5069849c7e32c9b0e6767c70dca7","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-20-14-44-18.png)\n\n# Cerebrarium\n\n> **Where I sow my cerebral seeds and tend to them.**\n\nThis is my current attempt to _**actively consume**_ information,\nand also try to travel back in time and excavate what I have been dumping into my head without any consideration.\n\nMost of the documents here will not make sense as they are working copies of my projects and ideas.

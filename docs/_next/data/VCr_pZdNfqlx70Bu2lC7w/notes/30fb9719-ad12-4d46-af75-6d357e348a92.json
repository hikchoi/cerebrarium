Perpendicular to the aluminum brushing. I suspect poor packaging on the seller's end. It was shoved in a plastic baggy barely big enough to fit both the panels and the pcb with no other protection (just in a box with a dozen more pcbs and panels). I was more frustrated with the poor quality of the Veils panels so I didn't mention these. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-01-06 11:19 PM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rest of the components that were missing arrived with the veils component order.</li>\n<li>I'm pretty excited for this build.

This is a problem with component placement, or the amount of paste on one side of the pad. Usually the component will stand up on it's own if there was too much solder paste on one side though\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-01-16-21-49-42.png\"></li>\n<li>Another ball-up. This one is a bit subtle but from the sides I can see that the resistor is slightly lifted on one side. The balled up side actually does not have contact with the pad/solder\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-01-16-21-53-40.png\"></li>\n<li>This is an odd one. Solder balled up on the component and not on the pad. This is most likely due to dried up solder paste and slightly lifted component.</li>\n<li>It's possible that the pad has contact with the component, but I will touch this up just in case\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-01-16-22-07-57.png\"></li>\n<li>Rouge ball of solder on each side of the 1206 capacitor.</li>\n<li>Simply running the iron and dragging it to one side of the pad will fix this.</li>\n<li>I can see this on every single 1206 package.\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-01-16-22-09-13.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Loupé\n<ul>\n<li>Another check with a loupé as a microscope is limited to a bird's eye view and its resolution</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-01-17 12:00 PM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yesterday, after inspection I cleaned up bridges and dry joints.</li>\n<li>Due to the amount of solder paste, I had to wick away some solder from the bridges on the STM32.\n<ul>\n<li>As a result, I took away a bit too much solder, which resulted in a (potentional) dry joint\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-01-17-12-02-42.png\"></li>\n<li>I remedied this by applying a lot of flux, then dragging the iron along the pins to evenly distribute the existing solder to the pins that have dry joints.\n<ul>\n<li>On some sides there weren't enough left to drag around, so I tinned the iron with the tiniest amount of solder and did the same. with enough flux, this will not bridge the pins.</li>\n<li>Just the right amount of solder would be left behind on each joint\n<img src=\"/assets/images/2021-01-17-15-15-26.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Soldered all the hardware except the potentiometer and jacks.</li>\n<li>Turns out the DIP socket + pin headers listed in the Bill of Materials for the OLED header lifts the screen a tiny bit too high. There is not enough space between the screen and the panel for the panel to fit.\n<ul>\n<li>I could substitue them with low profile sockets, but I didn't have it stocked.</li>\n<li>It would have also worked if I replaced only the male headers, but unfortunately these male headers do not fit in DIP sockets.</li>\n<li>At this point, my option is to:\n<ol>\n<li>Purchase low profile sockets (mouser reference : <a href=\"https://kr.mouser.com/ProductDetail/3M-Electronic-Solutions-Division/929984-01-20-RK/?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduh65k0%252BENFIKH%2FjmgqQmrFcQW016WE0H3Ua5m7VtlBHQinfFgBmn0lN&#x26;utm_source=octopart&#x26;utm_medium=aggregator&#x26;utm_campaign=517-929984-01-20-RK&#x26;utm_content=3M\">517-929984-01-20-RK</a>)</li>\n<li>Pull out a few pins and hack up my own headers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Safest bet is to go with the low profile sockets. These are the same ones used for the Westlicht Performer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Technically, at this point I could power it up and see if it flashes properly. If it doesn't flash properly, I need to work on the STM32 joints again.</li>\n<li>I decided to wait until I get the height of the screen properly before flashing, because having a screen just feels better when the module boots up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-01-17 3:18 PM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I will have to add the proper headers for the screens in my next mouser cart.</li>\n<li>I have the Fade, Kinks, Plaits, Stages left to build, so I'll choose one and order the components with the headers I need.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-01-22 9:56 PM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacement headers arrived</li>\n<li>Desoldering original</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-01-22 10:59 PM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finished desoldering original</li>\n<li>It was a pain in the ass</li>\n<li>Preci-dip 20 pin connectors are a pain in the fucking ass to desolder</li>\n<li>CHECK LEVELS OF ANY OLED SCREEN WITH THE PANELS BEFORE SOLDERING PIN HEADERS</li>\n<li>CHECK LEVELS OF ANY OLED SCREEN WITH THE PANELS BEFORE SOLDERING PIN HEADERS</li>\n<li>CHECK LEVELS OF ANY OLED SCREEN WITH THE PANELS BEFORE SOLDERING PIN HEADERS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-01-23 1:03 AM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tried flashing on a Mac.

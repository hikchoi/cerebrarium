Completely messed up my dish (failed attempt at sea bass steak), felt pretty shitty and decided I am ordering takeout instead.</li>\n<li>I usually cook for myself, so anything takeout would be a bit too heavy for me. This kinda knocked me out and I didn't have the willpower to get to what I wanted to work on today.</li>\n<li>Went for a walk again, and this time it wasn't too bad.</li>\n<li>Came back home, decided that today is not the day. Just killed time watching random youtube videos and got into bed.</li>\n<li>Couldn't sleep because I had an unplanned nap and haven't been awake long enough to drain myself.</li>\n<li>Stayed in bed for a few hours and got out at like 3AM.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2021-08-01 17:32</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Get your shit together</em></li>\n<li>This seems to be the most frequent thing I write in my pocket notebook.</li>\n<li>This is usually when I kinda need a reset on my sleep schedule and my energy.</li>\n<li>Idea: templatize the getting-your-shit-together days for expedited get-your-shit-togethery.</li>\n<li>Steps: \n<ul>\n<li>Grab a big, but healthy meal. Something you are very familiar with and will fill you up.</li>\n<li>Go for a walk. 20-30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Take a shower.</li>\n<li>Sit down and time-block the rest of your day.\n<ul>\n<li>Aim is to achieve minimum baseline productivity and then <em>one</em> small goal that will let you feel you have spent the rest of your day pretty well.\n<ul>\n<li>Get all chores done and read for 2 hours.</li>\n<li>Get all chores done and draw something.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Go through shutdown routine and <em>make sure next day's journal is properly filled and time-blocked</em></li>\n<li>If you still have energy or drive left to do something, continue on with the one task you did.

Cerebrarium\n\n> **Where I sow my cerebral seeds and tend to them.**\n\nThis is my current attempt to _**actively consume**_ information,\nand also try to travel back in time and excavate what I have been dumping into my head without any consideration.\n\nMost of the documents here will not make sense as they are working copies of my projects and ideas. This page is the entrypoint to my thoughts but there isn't a clearly sorted order of navigation. I simply decided to share these publicly to facilitate easy sharing and _**thinking out loud**_\n\nI plan to keep more polished and complete posts in my [main website](https://markhyunikchoi.com) and use this place as a nursery for my thoughts.\n\nThis is my [[PARA|cerebrarium.pkm.para]], my [[Zettelkasten|cerebrarium.pkm.zettelkasten]], my second brain. This is my Eudaimonia Machine. This is my kitchen-sink-crucible of tools that hopefully helps me think better. \n","schema":{"schemaId":"cerebrarium","moduleId":"cerebrarium"}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enableLinkCandidates":true,"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["cerebrarium","ext","inbox","daily","proj"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"gh_edit_repository":"https://github.com/hikchoi/cerebrarium","logo":"vault/assets/images/2020-12-20-14-44-18.png","siteFaviconPath":"vault/assets/images/favicon.ico","siteUrl":"https://cerebrarium.garden","githubCname":"cerebrarium.garden","title":"cerebrarium","author":"hikchoi","description":"Personal knowledge space","siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"cerebrarium"},"version":4,"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"none","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"selection","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false}},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.71.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"enableEditorDecorations":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false}}},"__N_SSG":true}

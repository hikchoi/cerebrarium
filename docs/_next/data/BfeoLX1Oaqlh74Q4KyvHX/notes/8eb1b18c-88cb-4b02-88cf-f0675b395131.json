Maybe it's because I find it boring? It's an essential part of a modular system but on paper it's such a simple device.</p>\n<p>This time I finally remembered to plan a Veils build, but I recieved a blemished panel, which rubbed me in the wrong way. Coincidentally, good panels are out of stock and I will have to wait a few weeks / months to get a replacement. Many angry e-mails have been sent back and forth with the vendor.</p>\n<p>I eventually calmed down and ordered the required components for the build. However I realized later on that the PCBs are a 0603 adaptation of Veils and I ordered 0402 components. Some kind of karma I guess.</p>\n<p>This is not a huge problem though. I have a few options from here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build it with 0402 components anyways</li>\n<li>Use this as an opportunity to learn how to order pcbs / fr4 panels from a pcb manufacturing service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both are viable options, but since Veils v2 hardware designs are released, I want to try ordering pcbs and panels for that instead of these. My original intention for building the v1 was to at least have VCAs in my system while I wait for v2.</p>\n<p>All components other than the 0402 packages seem to be identical. I just have to try to fit the 0402 packages between the pads spaced for 0603. This will be a bit tricky because I have to figure out how much solder paste I have to apply for each pad to compensate for the spacing difference. Luckily, I have two to build.</p>\n<p>2020-12-31 8:43 PM</p>\n<p>Shortly after I realized I ordered wrong packages for the build, I had to find something to control my frustration. The blemish panels for Veils was giving me bad vibes and I didn't want to look at them again. </p>\n<p>So I grabbed a sanding disc and started peeling off the anodization and silk screen. After a few angry passes and then some with a finer grit, it looked pretty good. Not a perfect finish but miles better than looking at a b-stock panel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2020-12-31-21-30-50.png\">\n<em>blemish panel vs sanded panel</em></p>\n<p>The finish isn't perfect, but I like the gritty look of the raw panels. I could keep it as is or polish it more. Maybe sticker bomb it? It will be a good panel to experiment stuff on.</p>\n<p>I should look into making my own <a href=\"/notes/a3e4141a-9acb-4d11-a288-f3d5381399ea\">panels</a></p>\n<p>2021-01-06 11:15 PM</p>\n<p>The components arrived. 0402 components are... way too small.\nI'll wait until the weekend to try building one of the veils.</p>\n<p>Looks like the 0603 adapted pads have just enough space to fit a 0402 components between them, so it's definitely possible to use the original size.</p>\n<p>I tried picking one of the resistors up with a tweezer and to my surprise, I think the static makes it stick to the tweezers. I guess they aren't ESD like they are advertized?\nI always clean them with IPA so it's not sticking onto the residual flux for sure.</p>\n<p>2021-01-09 3:20 PM</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Started

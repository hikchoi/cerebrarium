<ul>
<li>
<p>Parts</p>
<ul>
<li>In sci-fi, we aren't creating something comepletely new from nothing.</li>
<li>So we should understand how things that exist in real life works
<ul>
<li>look at parts from cars, bikes, aircrafts, etc</li>
<li>especially look at how moving parts are connected to the main body of a vehicle / machine
<ul>
<li>hinges</li>
<li>wheels</li>
<li>pneumatics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what are the function of these parts in the machine as a whole?</li>
<li>things that are hidden but appear when it is needed.</li>
<li><em>why</em> does it look that way?
<ul>
<li>shape
<ul>
<li>can it look different and function the same?</li>
<li>can it be bigger?</li>
<li>can we have multiples of the same part, and if so, will if function the same?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>location
<ul>
<li>can it be attached somewhere else and function the same?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>pistons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hinges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cylinders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plate detail</p>
<ul>
<li>parting lines of each plate</li>
<li>how they are bolted together
<ul>
<li>distance between bolts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>wires</p>
<ul>
<li>why are these wires here?
<ul>
<li>what is being sent here?</li>
<li>where is it coming from?</li>
<li>where is it connected?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>going back to the notion of "science fiction is based on real life", it is natural that we base each individual part of a mechanism off real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without this, there would be no connection to real life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Say we are designing a propeller for this sci-fi concept.
<ul>
<li>Just manipulating shapes to be "futuristic" and adding non-sense parts around it to make it look complex would not work.
<ul>
<li>The viewer would need to find a connection between this concept and real life, and have a reasonable understanding of how that thing works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>sillouette can come later</p>
<ul>
<li>the designer can have complete freedom here as long as it still holds a pinch of truth and maintain the connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>this doesn't mean you need to have deep understanding of how mechanisms work in real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but the things that are visible in the design, e.g.) how a cylinder is placed and how it moves, are bound to the realm of real life physics. You can't make that up.</p>
<ul>
<li>locally, where the viewer's focus would go, would need to have something that looks like it would <em>work</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>plausibility</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>having the freedom to design a un-real, out of the world object, that looks like it would work if it were a real thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>discovering interesting mechanisms in real life reference that could be generalized and used in different parts of your design then, is an important skill to hone when you are designing sci-fi concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>look at sizes of bolts, sizes of cylinders and pipes and how they twist and turn</p>
<ul>
<li>you don't have to <em>understand</em> why they are like that, but they are good grounding points to the real world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>reduce a reference down to parts that are <em>essential</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>try to preserve them functionally in your design.</li>
<li>the rest can then be then imagined to look like something out of the world and appealing.
<ul>
<li>again, within the constraint of conventional understanding of what this object exists for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>finding balance in density.</p>
<ul>
<li>not all surface of a mechanic object should be complex.</li>
<li>you should go back and forth and find the right balance for detail density in order to lead the viewer's eyes to certain places.
<ul>
<li>otherwise there's no place to put their eyes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>start with a simple sillouette, look at references and find a visual balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>try to replicate that balance with your own details</li>
<li>rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>iterate. what started as X doesn't necessarily need to be that until the end (of course if you are not obligated to deliver a certain thing. This is about exploring the design space)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vehicles">Vehicles<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vehicles"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plausibility first, then aesthetics</p>
<ul>
<li>then we should carefully observe how real life vehicles function / look like</li>
<li>not like a vehicle engineer, but even a superficial / rough understanding of how parts work will help coming up with new concepts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flying vehicles</p>
<ul>
<li>environment
<ul>
<li>is it flying in space? in Earth's atmosphere?
<ul>
<li>friction</li>
<li>air</li>
<li>aerodynamics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>these factors will affect how the overall shape of the vehicle looks (gives plausibility)
<ul>
<li>e.g.) doesn't make sense to have a blob shaped vehicle to fly around an environment where air / friction exists</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>things to ask</p>
<ul>
<li>how does an airplane fly?</li>
<li>why does it need wings?</li>
<li>why are wings shaped that way?</li>
<li>why are rockets pointy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>then how do we deviate from real life vehicles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>borrow shapes from other things. Could be anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>try to find a way to grab the shape from non-vehicles, then try to make that into one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>e.g. dolphin shaped shapeship</p>
<ul>
<li>of course, they should look like they can fly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is just an example. you can find shapes from anywhere. This is what you should practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>build your visual library</li>

<h2 id="thumbnailing">Thumbnailing<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#thumbnailing"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>thumbnailing</p>
<ul>
<li>sketch out
<ul>
<li>rough shape
<ul>
<li>a little bit of detail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>scale</li>
<li>sillouette</li>
<li>black &#x26; while
<ul>
<li>no color at this point</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>explore different designs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>start with a simple shape, and carve out details and sillouette</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detail</p>
<ul>
<li>we aren't looking to define intricate details, but rather find where we want them.
<ul>
<li>we want to <em>find</em> where we want simple, where we want busy.</li>
<li>this can happen while finding the sillouette or you can be more intentional with marking some details where you think is necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>find locations of key elements of the vehicle</p>
<ul>
<li>where does the booster go?</li>
<li>pipes? wires?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>scale</p>
<ul>
<li>compared to the size of a human, how big is this vehicle?
<ul>
<li>draw in some crowd</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>scale determines how much detail you will going to put in this vehicle
<ul>
<li>size of bolt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>line vs planes</p>
<ul>
<li>you can sketch thumbnails with lines or planes
<ul>
<li>planes would be faster but you would need to go back with a fine line to capture the rough balance of detail later.</li>
<li>use it to quickly find the sillouette you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internals--shell-of-vehicle">internals / shell of vehicle<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#internals--shell-of-vehicle"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take a look at different refernces of shells and internal parts of a vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make note of the balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>how exposed are the internals?
<ul>
<li>depending on the environment, you might not see exposed internals at all.</li>
<li>shells are there for protection</li>
<li>color and finish of the shells will be different too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>to make sense of the balance of internal / external detail, it might be easier to start with planes rather than going straight into lines for thumbnailing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>start with a very light shade, and gradually add onto the initial plane as you find balance and sillouette.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="size-of-vehicle">Size of vehicle<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#size-of-vehicle"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Size matters when you are designing a vehicle</li>
<li>depending on the size, they will have different purposes and will have different focus / components in the design.</li>
</ul>

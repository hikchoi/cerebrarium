<h2 id="fears-about-yourself">Fears About Yourself<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fears-about-yourself"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>When you act out of fear, your fears come true.</em></li>
<li>Two types of fear:
<ul>
<li>Fear about yourself
<ul>
<li>Prevents you from doing your best</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear about the reception of your work by others.
<ul>
<li>Prevents you from doing you own work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pretending">Pretending<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pretending"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fear that you are just pretending to do art.</li>
<li>Comes from doubting your credentials as an artist.</li>
<li>Sometimes you will hit a wall and work becomes slow. Here, if you believe that art can only be made by extraordinary people, this wall will confirm that you are not.</li>
<li>Art (both making and viewing) takes a lot of energy, and the <em>art is for extraordinary people</em> mindset gives you an excuse to quit.</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^rMDCTFEKrQzE" href="#^rMDCTFEKrQzE"></a>You may sometimes feel like you are pretending to be an artist, but this is impossible. 
<ul>
<li>Your work not being recieved well or not being exhibited somewhere does not make you a pretender. This is a completely different issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone has to do an artist's work, and you are doing it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="talent">Talent<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#talent"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talent is about <em>what comes easily</em>, and you will reach a point where things don't come easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pondering about how much talent you have is the most wasteful thing you could do in art. It is also the most common sentiment artists have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talent <em>may</em> give someone a head start, but without direction or goal it is meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who rely on talent will peak quickly and fade quicker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mozart improved his work by working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artist get better by improving their skills / learning new ones</p>
<ul>
<li>by working.</li>
<li>by learning new things from their past work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does it not come easily then?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because art is hard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practical questions about talent</p>
<ul>
<li>Who cares? Nobody.</li>
<li>Who would know? Nobody.</li>
<li>What difference will it make? None.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="perfection">Perfection<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#perfection"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Art is human, error is human, <em>ergo</em>, art is error.</li>
<li>Your art will inevitably be flawed.</li>
<li>If art needs to be perfect, no existing work would qualify as art.</li>
<li>To require perfection is to invite paralysis.</li>
<li>Demanding perfection is to deny humanity.</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^63VoyHdA8jil" href="#^63VoyHdA8jil"></a>The seed of you next work lies within the imperfections of your current piece. 
<ul>
<li>These are your guides that are valuable and reliable.</li>
<li>These give meaning to the art you are making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="annihilation">Annihilation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#annihilation"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some equate themselves with their art too much that they equate not making art with not being.</li>
<li>This is a common but mostly overdrawn existential fear that some part of you dies when you stop making art.</li>
<li>It is true, and the risk of not doing work depends on your need and desire to make stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="magic">Magic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#magic"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^sgrp0vGhGXdk" href="#^sgrp0vGhGXdk"></a><em>Maybe making art requires something special, something magical, that I don't have?</em> </li>
<li>This belief gives you the need to prove that your work does have some magic to it.</li>
<li>With this mindset, when the work does turn out good, you are inclined to believe it's a fluke. If it doesn't, it's an omen.</li>
<li>There might be something special needed in order to make art, but it isn't a universal one. It will be personal to each individual artist.
<ul>
<li>But it doesn't matter.</li>
<li>Point is, whatever that person has, even if you had it, it wouldn't help. If <em>you</em> had some kind of magic, it will help, but you probably don't need it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expectations">Expectations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#expectations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Balance between imagination and calculation.
<ul>
<li>Too much imagination: you are filled with fantasies</li>
<li>Too much calculation: you spend your life generating to-do lists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expectations can very easily drift into imagination.
<ul>
<li>Almost always leads to disillusionment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expectations based on the work itself is the most useful to the artist.
<ul>
<li>What do you need to do on your next piece? The last piece has the information.</li>
<li>Your work is your guide and reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So you need to look at your work without judegment / need or fear / hopes / expectations.</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^Jm3ntoEebkD0" href="#^Jm3ntoEebkD0"></a>It is about asking what your work needs, not what <em>you</em> need. </li>

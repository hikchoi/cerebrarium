## The Nature of the Problem

- Nowadays, making art means facing uncertainties and doubts. ^KyVEyFcV2lyU
  - Doing something nobody might care whether you do, doing something that you might not get rewarded for.
  - Making art means despite these hurdles you find meaning within the work itself. ^GBvJ5I9iGGqU

- fatalism: the fear that your fate is in your hands, but your hands are weak.

- Assumptions
1. Artmaking involves skills that can be learned. ^AcUEhhFXDSys
    - It's not a magical gift.
    - Being an artist means:
      - learning to accept yourself (makes your art personal)
      - follow your own voice (makes your art distinctive)
    - These qualities are clearly something that can be learned.
2. Art is made by ordinary people. ^vc0OUGjsSfn4
    - A flawless creature does not need to make art.
    - In turn, this means an ideal artist would be an ordinary person with all the flaws and weaknesses.
    - These are things that get in the way of making art, but it is what drives us to make art.
    - Making art has to do with overcoming these.
3. Making art and viewing art are different at their core. ^YHpWMDrfGp2U
    - Making art gives you an accurate measure of what you intended to do and what you actually did.
    - To everyone else, what matters is the end product. To yourself, and you alone, the process is what matters.
      - Artmaking can be lonely and thankless.
    - There is no good reason anyone else _should_ care about any art other people make.
      - You learn _how to make your work_ by _making your work_.
      - learning to make your own work is not anyone else's problem.
4. Artmaking has been around longer than the art establishment. ^MpBMOMvu6nPo
    - People have been making art long before the concept of self, consciousness has entered humanity.
    - The notion of art being a _self-expression_ is a rather contemporary concept.
      - If you make flawed art, does that make you a flawed person?
      - If you make no art at all, are you not a person at all?
    - It is best to not get into the trap of this and think that art has many paths.

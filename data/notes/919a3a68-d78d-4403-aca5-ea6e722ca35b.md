# Cerebrarium

> **Where I sow my cerebral seeds and tend to them.**

This is my current attempt to _**actively consume**_ information,
and also try to travel back in time and excavate what I have been dumping into my head without any consideration.

Most of the documents here will not make sense as they are working copies of my projects and ideas. This page is the entrypoint to my thoughts but there isn't a clearly sorted order of navigation. I simply decided to share these publicly to facilitate easy sharing and _**thinking out loud**_

I plan to keep more polished and complete posts in my [main website](https://markhyunikchoi.com) and use this place as a nursery for my thoughts.

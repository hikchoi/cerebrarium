<ul>
<li>Making art means despite all the hurdles, you find meaning within the <em>work itself</em>.
<ul>
<li>The main hurdle for me doesn't seem to be in artmaking itself.
<ul>
<li>But I should not rule out the effect of the art related fear that feeds back to my anxiety.</li>
<li>Maybe use art as a vehicle of solving the bigger problems with anxiety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The larger issue is my general anxiety, which rewires me to seek small and immediately-gratifiable things in place of things that require commitment.
<ul>
<li>I may need to explore the relationship between anxiety and distraction, commitment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write a small set of rules, or a manifesto of sort, that can remind you about the root of the fears in artmaking.</li>

<a href="/notes/EvqU0FLR8sBlu0R1">Art and Fear</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This was a wonderful book that taught you about the various fears you would get by being an artists as well as what it meant to be an artist.</li>
<li>The first part of the book was very interesting and useful for me, but part 2 was mostly irrelevant, so I have omitted it from summarizing them.
<ul>
<li>About career and academia within the art field.</li>
<li>I may get back to it if I ever get involved in that, but not for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main points that resonated with me:
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/luKtgJwHwg7RVQIjDwRME#^KyVEyFcV2lyU">Making art means facing uncertainties and doubts</a>
<ul>
<li>I think this is a very practical definition.</li>
<li>As a person with a lot of anxiety in general, I am very prone to avoid things that are uncertain. Uncertainty paralyzes me. I think this is part of the root cause of what I've been struggling to figure out.
<ul>
<li>As much I love and fantasize about making art, it doesn't come as easy. I have very short bursts of drive for making art which quickly dwindles down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The book goes straight to the point, and is very convincing:
<ul>

<a href="/notes/luKtgJwHwg7RVQIjDwRME">Chapter 1</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The first chapter establishes some assumptions the authors are making in order to describe what the fears are and what it means.
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/luKtgJwHwg7RVQIjDwRME#^AcUEhhFXDSys">Artmaking involves skills that can be learned</a>
<ul>
<li>A typical cliche advice that people give to struggling artists, but the important distinction is that they emphasize that <em>accepting yourself</em> and <em>following your own voice</em> is something that can be learned, and thus means <em>being an artist is something that you can teach yourself to do</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/luKtgJwHwg7RVQIjDwRME#^vc0OUGjsSfn4">Art is made by ordinary people</a>
<ul>
<li>Describes the common pitfalls all artists fall into: believing that the <em>good</em> ones are special. Also a cliche advice, but the reasoning is interesting.
<ul>
<li>That it is <em>necessary</em> to be an ordinary person to make art, because it is what drives the artist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/luKtgJwHwg7RVQIjDwRME#^YHpWMDrfGp2U">Making art and viewing art are different</a>
<ul>
<li>What matters to you is what you get out of the process, what matters to others is the end result. This point is further explained in <a href="/notes/dnF3fDtURfMsKwzB4pWH8">Chapter 4</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/luKtgJwHwg7RVQIjDwRME#^MpBMOMvu6nPo">The notion of art being a self-expression can be a double edge sword</a>
<ul>
<li>This is something a lot of artists believe, and the danger of doing so is that it's easy to think that you are flawed because your art is flawed (or you think it is).</li>
<li>It's arguable, I generally agree with this, but it feels weaker than the other points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What can I get out of this?
<ul>
<li>One actionable I can think of is a small manifesto about how I would approach artmaking, that I can come back to whenever I am struggling and need a refresher on what my fears are.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<a href="/notes/bfRuIC2xn22L8dJrB6dPN">Chapter 2</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/bfRuIC2xn22L8dJrB6dPN#^QgLc00UDcxI2">Quitting means not starting again, but art is all about starting again</a>
<ul>
<li>This pretty much sums up everything about chapter 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reasons artists quit doesn't really seem to apply to me <em>yet</em>, but it may be something that I have to think about later on.
<ul>
<li>Convincing themselves that their next effort will fail</li>
<li>Lose destination.</li>
<li>I'm probably closer to the former than the latter, because I haven't really found a destination at all yet, and I'm still very much struggling to learn how the materials react to what I do to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/bfRuIC2xn22L8dJrB6dPN#^beDUjUvSguJQ">Make friends with others who make art, and share your work frequently</a>
<ul>
<li>This is prime advice.</li>
<li>I feel like I never had people to share my work, and on any rare occasions I've shared, it felt great and gave me a lot of drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some strategies that I can immediately try to implement for myself:
<ol>
<li>Remind yourself that it's natural that sometimes the result of executing your vision can be disappointing.</li>
<li>What you have the most control over is how the material reacts to your input.
<ul>
<li>Practicing more and just <em>doing a lot of work</em> will give you more control over the material.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other than that, it's all about how <em>you</em> react to the uncertainties.
<ul>
<li>Train yourself to be resilient to surprises and mistakes.</li>
<li>Use this as your advantage: stash these mistakes and discrepancies between your vision and execution and make sure you address that on your next project.
<ul>
<li>Your next project will have more of those for the next one as well.</li>
<li><em>Not</em> having those would probably mean another type of artistic death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<p><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT">Chapter 3</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT#^rMDCTFEKrQzE">It is impossible to pretend to be an artist</a>
<ul>
<li>You either do art or you don't.</li>
<li>Getting good reactions from your work is a completely separate thing from <em>being</em> an artist. You did the work, you <em>are</em> an artist. Simple as that.</li>
<li>I wonder if I ever thought like this.
<ul>
<li>I do sometimes think I'm pretending, but it's because I'm not really physically doing any work at all, and just <em>fantasizing</em> about doing it.
<ul>
<li>I guess it's a valid thing to say in this case.</li>
<li>Probably not healthy to keep that thought lingering around though.</li>
<li>Let's try to use this as a reminder that we are <em>hesitating</em> for some reason, and find a way to put down that first brushstroke.
<ul>
<li>Once the strokes flow out, this feeling tends to go away from me, which is at least a good sign that I'm not falling into this unhealthy ideation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT#^63VoyHdA8jil">Use the imperfections to your advantage moving forward</a>
<ul>
<li>Art should be <em>fueled</em> by imperfection, and used as something that will guide you through your subsequent works.</li>
<li>Making note of the things I need to improve and time-boxing my project to a certain deadline could artificially create a cycle where I am incrementally improving myself.
<ul>
<li>This can be true for both <em>familiarity of material</em>, and <em>how I react to my own work</em>.</li>
<li><em>Aim for 75%</em>, which is my mantra for everything could also be applied here.
<ul>
<li>How do we quantify the work we are doing?
<ul>
<li>I can't quantify <em>how good</em> my work is; at least without a prior definition of my goals.
<ul>
<li>The goal really has to be quantifiable as well so no good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I can come up with a quantifiable goal before I start any project, that would be great.
<ul>
<li>But this may become yet another blocker for doing actual work and prefering incremental growth.</li>
<li>Can I come up with a rule-of-thumb-ish general goal that I can use for any project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to come up with this has blocked me from doing any art for the past few weeks. Oh the irony.
<ul>
<li>Let's wing it for now but come back to this later.</li>

<li><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT#annihilation">Annihilation</a>
<ul>
<li>Equating myself to the art I make was something I did in the past, but that was with a big pinch of grandiose sense of self importance. I think I'm past that point and just think of it as a fun thing and just one corner of me as a person.
<ul>
<li>Definitely an important one, but not something that defines me existentially.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes I think my imagination has dried out? or not much vivid any more.
<ul>
<li>When I read a novel or something, it was easy for me to picture what's happening in my head, in a very vivid way. Now it's very hazy if it even happens.</li>
<li>I'm slightly bummed out by that fact, but I'm not sure where I stand with this yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The desire to make stuff is definitely strong. But it's not something that stands in front of me these days, I feel.
<ul>
<li>Whenever I <em>do</em> make stuff, it fills me with joy, but when I don't it doesn't bother me on a surface level (or at least I think it's hiding behind my head and just lurking in the dark, and I'm confused with what I'm frustrated with all the time).</li>
<li>I think just doing it a lot is the natural remedy to this. We'll have to see if it works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT#^sgrp0vGhGXdk">Maybe making art requires something special that I don't have</a>
<ul>
<li>I definitely did think this way, but on the opposite end of the spectrum.</li>
<li>I thought <em>I</em> had that special something, but I just haven't honed it enough yet.
<ul>
<li>This is a double edged sword because the momeny you start doubting it, you are oscillating between the two extreme ends of the spectrum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now I'm more relaxed with this kind of ideation, but I still do think I naturally have a better-than-average affinity to art than your average Joe.</li>
<li>It's comforting to think that even if some kind of magic exists, it is on a personal level and something that is not that important in actually making art.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT#expectations">Expectations</a>
<ul>
<li>Big expectations on my ability to make art. definitely.</li>
<li>Disillusionment always come after the spike of productivity that I sometimes have with art, which quickly dies down.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/O0xVehhBzmJhGfigmm8sT#^Jm3ntoEebkD0">It is about asking what your _work_ needs, not what _you_ need</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a great way of thinking about this issue.</li>
<li>Ties together with equating your art with your existence. When your work doesn't come out as you would expect, it's the <em>work</em> that needs to be improved, not <em>you</em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>As a hobbyist, I don't think I have this problem too much.</li>
<li>My art is very personal to me, to a point other people's opinion don't matter that much? Maybe because my life doesn't depend on it.</li>

<li><a href="/notes/dnF3fDtURfMsKwzB4pWH8#understanding">Understanding</a>

<li>I don't think the art that I do has any depth yet to be misunderstood by other people. It's just little things that I find fun to draw.</li>
<li>Very fortunate that this is the case.</li>
<li>I may get into more depth with my art at some point, but I will have to come back to this later.</li>

<ul>
<li>This rings truth. Doing a <em>lot of art</em> is the best way to produce <em>good</em> art.</li>
<li>Just like I've been semi-automating a lot of things in my life that I want less overhead before starting, I should do the same with making art.</li>
<li>After all, art is a personal thing and you learn about art by doing it. Making it easier to start doing art is the easiest way to start improving.</li>

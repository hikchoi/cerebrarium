# On error handling

- [MDN - Error object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)
- [MDN - Control flow and error handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling)

## Notes

- You would create an `Error` object with the intention of `throw`ing it. Which you want ot handle in a `try...catch` block.
- `try...catch` considered... unnecessary???
    - Coming from Python, it is a bit strange that some threads on the internet is saying errors are preferably not thrown at all. Just let it crash?
- How do I annotate `Error` throwing behaviour in typescript?

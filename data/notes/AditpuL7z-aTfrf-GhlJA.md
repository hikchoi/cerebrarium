- using tags as a primary source of organization means you have to decide _for every note_ which tag(s) you want to use.
    - You are relying on memorizing all the tags you have made.
    - This a lot of up-front cost.

- We offload some of our cognitive processing onto our environment, and this is much more capable of storing information than our brain does.
    - e.g.) method of loci, memory palace.
- This concept is called _stigmergy_ (stigmergic cognition)
- Tags ignore stigmergy and force us to think about notes in abstract ways.

- In PKM, a constant temptation is to overorganize
    - too many categories
    - too many subdivisions

- As number of tags grew arithmetically, complexity grows geometrically.
    - A system that encourages tags is giving you explicit affordance to increase complexity.

- Tags were good when the cost of running a search was costly.
    - In these days, running a search is not a costly operation.
    - Thus the cost of tagging is almost completely wasted because almost the entire body of text could be broken into indexable, searchable "tags" that can be retrieved almost instantaniously.

<p>Reference-heavy collection of notes on various topics that I look up on the Internet frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>These notes should be immediately useful bites of references.
<ul>
<li>Don't just slap a list of links to other places tha have reference material unless it's absolutely necessary to do so.</li>
<li>If a source contains way more information than you need to process right now, find the highest possible hierarchy where the source could be noted for later. Add it to that note and come back to it later.
<ul>
<li>Goal is to make notes that only serve you a purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process the bits of knowledge in your own words first if it comes from an external source unless it's already in a form that is immediately usable (e.g. very specific set of flags for a cli command).</li>

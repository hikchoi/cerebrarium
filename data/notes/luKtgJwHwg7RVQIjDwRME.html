<p><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^KyVEyFcV2lyU" href="#^KyVEyFcV2lyU"></a>Nowadays, making art means facing uncertainties and doubts. </p>
<ul>
<li>Doing something nobody might care whether you do, doing something that you might not get rewarded for.</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^GBvJ5I9iGGqU" href="#^GBvJ5I9iGGqU"></a>Making art means despite these hurdles you find meaning within the work itself. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>fatalism: the fear that your fate is in your hands, but your hands are weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assumptions</p>

<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^AcUEhhFXDSys" href="#^AcUEhhFXDSys"></a>Artmaking involves skills that can be learned. 
<ul>
<li>It's not a magical gift.</li>
<li>Being an artist means:
<ul>
<li>learning to accept yourself (makes your art personal)</li>
<li>follow your own voice (makes your art distinctive)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These qualities are clearly something that can be learned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^vc0OUGjsSfn4" href="#^vc0OUGjsSfn4"></a>Art is made by ordinary people. 
<ul>
<li>A flawless creature does not need to make art.</li>
<li>In turn, this means an ideal artist would be an ordinary person with all the flaws and weaknesses.</li>
<li>These are things that get in the way of making art, but it is what drives us to make art.</li>
<li>Making art has to do with overcoming these.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^YHpWMDrfGp2U" href="#^YHpWMDrfGp2U"></a>Making art and viewing art are different at their core. 
<ul>
<li>Making art gives you an accurate measure of what you intended to do and what you actually did.</li>
<li>To everyone else, what matters is the end product. To yourself, and you alone, the process is what matters.
<ul>
<li>Artmaking can be lonely and thankless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no good reason anyone else <em>should</em> care about any art other people make.
<ul>
<li>You learn <em>how to make your work</em> by <em>making your work</em>.</li>
<li>learning to make your own work is not anyone else's problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^MpBMOMvu6nPo" href="#^MpBMOMvu6nPo"></a>Artmaking has been around longer than the art establishment. 
<ul>
<li>People have been making art long before the concept of self, consciousness has entered humanity.</li>
<li>The notion of art being a <em>self-expression</em> is a rather contemporary concept.
<ul>
<li>If you make flawed art, does that make you a flawed person?</li>
<li>If you make no art at all, are you not a person at all?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is best to not get into the trap of this and think that art has many paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>

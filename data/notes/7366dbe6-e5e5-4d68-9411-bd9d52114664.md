# notes

**2021-01-31**

- Purchased my first dioscorea elephantipes
- Estimated to be 7 year old
- seller comments
    - recommends watering every 7-10 weeks
        - adjust depending on how much vine growth you want.
        - slow down watering to every 2 weeks during the summer.
    - vines might wither down during the summer, but not always.
    - the body doesn't grow drastically. just the vines.
    - it will live up to 70 years.

<ul>
<li>Other people's reaction to your art doesn't need to cause problems for you but they do anyways.
<ul>
<li>We often confuse priorities of others and priorities of our own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a society, we are expecting artists to produce a personally imtimate and also generally alluring artwork.</li>
<li>When things go well we keep it to ourselves, but when it isn't we seek for external validation.</li>
<li>It is hard to not take criticism of your work when art is very much personal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding">Understanding<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#understanding"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Wanting to be understood is a basic need.</li>
<li>By presenting your art to the world, you are handing out the power of disapproval to others.
<ul>
<li>That may be true. Artists aren't generally someone who are viewed as a model of normalcy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What may be needed is some time for an artwork to achieve a state of understanding by the artist themselves. With that in place, external understanding or the lack thereof will be less of a problem to the artist.</li>
<li>Catering to the fear of misunderstanding and not following what you truly believe will limit your artwork to be something that can easily be understood by the audience.
<ul>
<li>By doing this you risk being arrogant and condescending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acceptance">Acceptance<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#acceptance"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Will my work be counted as art?</em></li>
<li>This leads to fear of your work percieved as craft, hobby, or decoration. (not art).
<ul>
<li>Even worse, nothing at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At some point this fear will collide with doing work that is true to you.</li>
<li>The world generally <em>does</em> reward authentic work, but the problem is that there is a temporal aspect to it; you may not be around to get the reward when it happens.
<ul>
<li>The world will generally try to understand work that already has been understood for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk not being understood by exploring new territories? </li>
<li>or take the proven path to be immediately understood?
<ul>
<li>This may be necessary, beneficial, and inevitable.</li>
<li>Everyone does have some period of recapitualtion.</li>
<li>The danger here is that you may be stuck there forever and not teach the future you anything new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A better question is <em>will your work be counted as <strong>your</strong> art?</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approval">Approval<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#approval"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Acceptance</em> and <em>approval</em> becomes linked and indistinguishable, but they are subtly different.
<ul>
<li>Acceptance: will it be counted as art?</li>
<li>Approval: will people like it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For artists, surviving means finding an environment where art is valued and encouraged.</li>
<li>These are <em>audience</em> related issues.
<ul>
<li>Audience comes later.</li>
<li>The only pure communication is between you and your work.</li>
</ul>
</li>

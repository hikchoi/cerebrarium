> "Everything starts from a dot." - Wassily Kandinsky

- Mathematically, a dot is a graphical illustration of a nildimensional space (a _point_).
  - That is, you can't see it really.
- However, as a primitive building block of art, it's blob of ink (or any medium) that is small enough for the human eye to perceive as a single point in space (which you can see!).
- Sometimes a dot can be perceived not from explicitly marking a surface with a blob of ink but in relation of two _lines_. Two lines intersecting can create a dot.

- A row of dots arranged becomes a line when it's close enough for the human eye to not be able to perceive the gap between each successive dot.

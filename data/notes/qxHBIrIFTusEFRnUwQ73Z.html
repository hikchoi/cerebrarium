<li>
<p>Anxiety and stress is our brains capacity to predict danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>An opportunity to look into to the future and be prepared for the possible outcomes.</li>
<li>Usually focused on negative consequences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It exists for a reason. It gives us the ability to avoid them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anxiety involves <em>you</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consequences <em>you</em> are anticipating to happen, and the preventative actions <em>you</em> may or may not take.</li>
<li>Insecurities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anxiety is a future-focused mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people may think they are worried about something that they did / happened in the past, but what they are doing is they are looking at the event that happened in the past and projecting the consequences into the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since anxiety is the ability to make predictions, the more you are capable of predicting what is going to happen, the worse your anxiety is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Response to anxiety.</p>

- Started drawing a female figure from a magazine as a reference (Last Sunday).
- Intended to do a quick croquis and move on, but the simple sillouette and gesture made me want to add more details
  - Normally people advise you to move on after a quick capture of the gesture and motion of a figure.
  - Not sure how I feel about this advice.
    - Sure, if you want to internalize drawing human figure fast, I think this makes sense. You are deliberately decoupling what outline of the image you are seeing and capturing the essential part of the reference.
    - But I am approaching human figure drawing from a different perspective:
      - I do want to get better at drawing human figures BUT my primary interest is to find something out there, develop a skill to replicate that in a believable manner, and then adding my own spin to it.
  - At some point I would need to grind out the deliberate practices to go past a plateauing progression, but for now I want this to be a _fun_ thing to do, something that _I want to wake up for_.

- Didn't have much time yesterday, but I managed to refine the lines and fix some of the parts that I wasn't happy with.
  - The shoe was drawn a bit out of perspective and wonky. the bottom of the left shoe was a bit crooked so that was fixed. surprisingly hard. 
    - I should do a study of drawing various style of shoes later.
    - I wanted the line work to be cleaner, but with a tiny bit of bleed. Adjusted the brush to be slightly more jagged than the typical hard round brush and went over the clean pass once again.
    - Shirt detail and the obstructed part of the torso (right arm) is somewhere I want to make visible than right now.

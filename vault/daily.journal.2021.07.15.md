## Notes

2021-07-15 06:51
- Taking notes on drawing was a great idea. This is already giving me more ideas (and the drive to execute it) more than anything else I tried with art the past 10 years.
  - A good precursor to [[exploring knowledge management for visual thinkers|cerebrarium.pkm.visual]]
- HANDS projects (name pending) is a great idea to practice and also would be a great excuse to order more stickers.

- The idea of having a _working surface_ that you can default to when taking notes was a simple but effective change that I internalized.
  - _Having a working surface_ means not having to worry about anything before jotting down your ideas.
  - These are all potentially expensive operations / blockers that require context switching from note taking:
    - Coming up with the name / title
    - Figuring out where the note belongs (heirarchy / folder)
    - The anxiety that comes from the possibility that this note is going to be lost in the void
    - Other notes begging for your attention.
- Not something I invented.
  - Journal notes and scratch notes are exactly serving this purpose.
    - Maybe even having another buffer where my thoughts go could be a good separation as well.
  - I just haven't thought about it in a spacial metaphor.
    - I keep my desk where I work as clean as possible all the time so that I don't get distracted by other things.
    - It's a place that I can reliably come to sit down and work right away when I need to.

- buffer note 
  - is a single note that has a fixed location where you stage your immediate ideas.
  - it has one purpose: to hold the idea that you have right now.
  - you flush the content of your notes to appropriate places in your pkm.
  - it is different from scratch notes or transient notes as you are making a conscious decision to create a scratch note (usually in a context of a different note, for the purpose of linking to/from it); buffer notes will always be there, and you are deferring the decision of note creation (in the right place and context) to a later time.
  - it is different from journal notes because buffer notes are not temporally organized. it is a spacial distinction from the rest of your notes.
  - it is a singleton note that will always be there and will always be uniquely there.
    - scratch notes minus the ability to have multiples.
  - blockers
    - if you cannot for some reason flush out the content of the buffer, you won't be able to proceed.

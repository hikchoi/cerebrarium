## Context

- I think it's finally time to embrace vim
- Recent RSI made me realize I need a more ergonomic work setup
- Efficiency. I want to know if vim really brings you that.

## Actionables

- [x] install vim plugin on vscode
- [ ] figure out how to gradually introduce vim keybindings that I actually use
- [ ] try following [Stephen's workflow](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/717965437182410786/798338552761024552)

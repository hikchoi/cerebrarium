- [[proj.HANDS]]
  - Did show me that being pedantic / deliberate with my drawing practice indeed pays off.
  - I think keeping this as a _default_ thing to do for art would let me keep doing something and not worry about _what_ to draw and stuff like that. things that really gives you the artist's block.

- Currently reading [Art & Fear](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733) by David Bayles. Should probably start a reading note on it.

- [[ext.six-structures-of-drawing]]
  - Suprisingly illustrates perfectly what I was looking for.
  - I was very loosely doing what the video was talking about in my own stuff but the pipeline was never externalized for me.
  - Some ideas for new hierarchies:
    - a hierarchies of primitives. `cerebrarium.art.primitives`
    - this is an entry point to structuralize everything i observe and try to draw.
    - simply putting in effort to practice drawing cubes and stuff would be already beneficial, but having a library of notes on what I learned in the process of practicing them would be good to have for the future to look up.

- [[cerebrarium.art.primitive]]
  - What should go into primitives?
    - probably start with a dot, then a line, then a shape, then volume.

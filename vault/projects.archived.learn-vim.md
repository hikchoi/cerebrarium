# Learn VIM

> **Learn the way of VIM**
> Start time: 
> End time: 
> Status: [[pending|tag.project.pending]]

## Context

- I think it's finally time to embrace vim
- Recent RSI made me realize I need a more ergonomic work setup
- Efficiency. I want to know if vim really brings you that.

## Actionables

- [x] install vim plugin on vscode
- [ ] figure out how to gradually introduce vim keybindings that I actually use
- [ ] try following [Stephen's workflow](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/717965437182410786/798338552761024552)

## Notes

**2021-04-15 12:51 AM**
- Might be worth following [this](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)
- also [this](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore)

- Following along the `Learn VIM` plugin.
- making notes in [[cerebrarium.dev.vim]]
- vscode vim is kind of... tacky...?
    - not liking it so far.
- Motions are cool but half of them don't work in emulation.
- This may need a LOT of fiddling with keybindings in vscode and I'm not up for that right now.

**2021-06-14 13:39**
- I have been using vim for a while for my daily programming and text editing tasks and I am quite comfortable with the basics.
- Learning VIM from now on will be an ongoing effort to improve my workflow using vim.

## Notes

- I have the `cerebrarium.reading` hierarchy for gathering notes that I took from reading.
- Similarly, I found a need to have a hierarchy for gathering notes that I took from watching videos and taking online classes.
- Basically, somewhere to park the notes that I took from _consuming_ information, that is not yet processes for the second time for other purposes. ^6KuDVWE4
- These may be different forms of media, but at the end they are information.
- I should have a more general hierarchy that can contain all of these.
  - At the end, it doesn't matter that it was a book, an article, or a video.
- These are called _fleeting notes_ in the Zettelkasten circle.
- Do I need another fancier name? Maybe for the purpose of not adhering to one methodology / internalizing it.

- This begs the question: What do I put in other hierarchies?
- I don't want my [[cerebrarium]] to become an encyclopedia. 
  - It has to have intention. 
    - To gather all knowledge is not my goal. It is to gather the knowledge that I care about that I will be actively digging up to acheive a certain goal in my life (and building an encyclopedia is not one of them.)
- Noticing a lot of notes in [[cerebrarium]] that are just placeholders or simply scratch notes that contain links to other resources.
  - It pains me to let them go, but they should go.
  - Most notes are notes that I made for the sake of growing my branches when I first started tending my digital garden anyways.
- Let's set a rule.
  - Every note has to have some kind of dialogue between the note and myself.
  - No note under [[cerebrarium]] should be something that I quickly jotted down and forgot about.

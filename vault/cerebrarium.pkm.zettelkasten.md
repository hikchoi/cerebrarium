- Zettelkasten is a popular method among academics and writers. I am neither of those (at least as a profession).
- I do however write for myself. With the breadth of topics and interests I have, it has been proven for many years (of my experience) that I cannot keep up with it.
- The main audience I want to reach is my future self and possibly the few people who are interested in looking into my brain while I [work with my garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu).
- Not all of this will have a end result of a piece of writing shipped. Some of these will become an art piece, a habit, or a dish; generally anything that is a part of my life.
- My goal is multi-faceted.

## Fleeting notes and literature notes
- I take notes in a lot of places: my phone (a quick message to myself), on a piece of paper, a pocket notebook, etc.
- Once they serve their purpose, I delete them. I don't think it's worth storing them in a central place.

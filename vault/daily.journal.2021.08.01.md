- Yesterday was a bit of a lackluster start of my precious weekend, so I think today could be a perfect time to reflect on it.

- Saturday brief:
  - Woke up later than I wanted to, it was already hot outside and I woke up not being refreshed, but because it was too hot to stay in bed.
  - Made breakfast, got some chores out of my way.
  - Went for a walk, but it was not a good day to be outside (especially around noon).
  - Came back home and read a book for about 2 hours, but I fell asleep for about 45 minutes, because I didn't get enough sleep to begin with.
  - Made dinner. Completely messed up my dish (failed attempt at sea bass steak), felt pretty shitty and decided I am ordering takeout instead.
  - I usually cook for myself, so anything takeout would be a bit too heavy for me. This kinda knocked me out and I didn't have the willpower to get to what I wanted to work on today.
  - Went for a walk again, and this time it wasn't too bad.
  - Came back home, decided that today is not the day. Just killed time watching random youtube videos and got into bed.
  - Couldn't sleep because I had an unplanned nap and haven't been awake long enough to drain myself.
  - Stayed in bed for a few hours and got out at like 3AM.

- _Get your shit together_
- This seems to be the most frequent thing I write in my pocket notebook.
- This is usually when I kinda need a reset on my sleep schedule and my energy.
- Idea: templatize the getting-your-shit-together days for expedited get-your-shit-togethery.
- Steps: 
  - Grab a big, but healthy meal. Something you are very familiar with and will fill you up.
  - Go for a walk. 20-30 minutes.
  - Take a shower.
  - Sit down and time-block the rest of your day.
    - Aim is to achieve minimum baseline productivity and then _one_ small goal that will let you feel you have spent the rest of your day pretty well.
      - Get all chores done and read for 2 hours.
      - Get all chores done and draw something.
  - Go through shutdown routine and _make sure next day's journal is properly filled and time-blocked_
  - If you still have energy or drive left to do something, continue on with the one task you did. Otherwise, wind down, do whatever.
  - Go to bed. Aim to get 7.5 hours of sleep.

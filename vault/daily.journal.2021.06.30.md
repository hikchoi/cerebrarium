[[cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1]]

- Ritualize
  - things to consider: 
    - Where
    - When
    - How you will work
    - What to do before
  - I will mostly bound to do deep work in front of my computer as I am a software engineer.
    - I will be free to be wherever I want if I get a laptop. However having a large screen and a proper ergonomic setup for long hours of coding is something that cannot be emulated in an ad-hoc fashion.
  - My work hours are non-linear and selective, meaning that I am free to change how my day is structured as long as I am present around my core working hours.
    - Given that I am rested well, I am most energetic an hour into my day.
    - I typically aim to wake up before 6AM, so starting at 7AM will be ideal.
    - Although my workday can be non-linear, I will initially try to stick to a near-linear work day until I am comfortable with the flow of it.
    - I will initially assume that I can maintain my concentration for a generous 4 hours of my day, so my deep work hours will be 7AM to 11AM.
  - Before going into my deep work session, I will lay out the problem I am trying to solve, and set up a goal for that session. Ideally, this will have already been done the previous day before work ends.
  - Before starting my deep work session, I need to make sure the following.
    - [ ] I have showered.
    - [ ] My desk is clean.
    - [ ] I have a cup of coffee and a light breakfast ready.
    - [ ] I have my personal, non-work related daily tasks laid out in my journal.
      - This is to have a peace of mind that I have the rest of the day scheduled out outside my work.

- Be Lazy
  - For the sake of physical health, I will allocate 5 minutes every hour of my deep work session to stretch and do a light workout.
  - At the end of my work day, I will do the following sequence to give myself closure for the day.
    - [ ] finish off daily journal.
    - [ ] Carry over unfinished tasks and plans to next day's journal.
    - [ ] Close all tabs and programs related to work and sync my workspace.
    - [ ] Clean up my desk 
    - [ ] Check my (personal) daily journal to check what I have to do after work.

[[cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-2]]

- Take breaks from focus.
  - As a software developer removing distraction (especially the Internet) is a very tricky thing to do, as a lot of reference material needed for work is on the web.
  - Some things to consider.
    - Blocker apps like https://selfcontrolapp.com/
      - a bit artificial, but may need something like this to begin.
    - Pre-emptively looking up references.
      - not very effective. you don't usually know what you need to look up beforehand.
    - Trust yourself to be mindful of distractions and try to naturally build the mental capacity to concentrate.
  - I am not entirely sure how to go about this, but will try using blocker apps and see how it goes.

- Work like teddy
  - Giving myself a strict deadline is something that I have not been doing a lot. Will try to incorporate this idea.

- productive medidation
  - I have already been doing this for my evening strolls, but not necessarily for well-defined problems I am trying to solve.
  - I would normally try to consume audiobooks or read articles and take quick notes in my phone.
  - Will try to use this time to solve problems instead of consuming external information.

- memorize a deck of cards
  - memorizing a deck of cards isn't something that particularly interests me, so I will have to figure out an activity that will push me to intensely focus.
  - What makes me focus?
    - Generally anything that sparks my interest at that moment.
  - It might be worth looking into a fixed activity to do that is repeatable for this purpose.
  
[[cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-3]]
- Instagram
  - I keep checking them, but I am not very active.
  - Simply reducing the frequency and time using it would work.
- Reddit
  - Time sink, but not active in it myself.
  - Not gaining much value from looking at it most of the time.
  - Putting on an audio book could subsitute this and probably be immensely more valuable.
- Youtube
  - Main time sink, but I do gain a lot from non-leisurely consumption of videos.
  - Try to be mindful of what you decide to watch.

[[cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-4]]
- schedule every minute of your day
  - this could be implemented in my pocket notebook.


[[daily.journal.2021.06.29]] and this note
- I have gone through the reading notes of [[deep work|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work]] and extracted actions that I can immediately take.
- [ ] take these and compile into a separate note that you can reference for any deep work related activities.

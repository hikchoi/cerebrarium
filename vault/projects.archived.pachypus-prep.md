Q. What kind of pot do I want to use?

- I currently have a transparent pot that has a lot of slit in it

![](/assets/images/2021-03-29-23-35-19.png)

- It is branded and sold as **Mesh pot** here, and interestingly it has a conical elevation inside which helps the plant to be placed for ideal rooting.
- I purchased it when I first though I would be rooting a failed pachypus, but I ended up not planting it because it had little to no sign of life left in it.
- I recently learned that using a transparent pot will promote moss growth inside the pot, which is NOT good for the plant (at least for plants from Madagascar I think).
- I have seen some people use this exact pot for rooting, but also have an outer pot that fits around it so that it blocks light.
- This I think is a good solution.
- Another option for me is to use a non-transparent perforated pot like these:

- These are modular pots. They come as perforated sheets and you also get a gridded bottom plate and put it together yourself.

- Looks like they most of them are already assembled if you are getting them retail.

- This eliminates the need for a secondary pot to block sunlight into the roots, but the downside is that I have no way to check inside the soil if I wanted to.

- It also looks harder to wrap around with a heated pad, so if I go with this pot I need an indoor greenhouse. (maybe I need one anyways)

- How does air circulation affect root growth?
  - Prevents waterlogging.

- So, in short I want a pot that can:
  1. let the roots breathe
  2. let me check the roots with ease
  3. block sunlight in order to prevent moss growth

I will use the transparent `mesh pot` I own, and also purchase a slightly larger modular perforated pot to enclose the transparent mesh pot. This way I can let the roots aerate, check the status of the roots by pulling it out of the outer pot, and also keep the modular pot on the outside to block sunlight.

2. What kind of soil mixture do I want to use?

- Most sources on the internet tells me I need a **well draining soil**
- Also, not everyone seems to be using the same thing. I guess it is more of an trail-and-error.
- According to some people in the Korean caudex community recommends 산야초.

![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-00-01-43.png)

- Now that I look at some of the caudices I've purchased from a shop, a lot of them are potted in this mixture. Both small and medium grain.

![](/assets/images/2021-03-30-00-02-35.png)

- What goes in it?
  - Satsuma soil (사스마토)
  - Sterilized "baked" soil (소성토)
  - Hyuga pumice (휴가토, 난석)
  - Kanuma soil (녹소토)
  - Pumice (경석)

- I think it is a safe bet to try out 산야초 and mix a bit of larger bits of akadama, kanuma, and a bit of compost with a few scoops of magamp K. maybe some volcanic soil too?

- Either way, I need to order a bag of 산야초

- While we are on the topic of soil, I also need a proper trowel, and a sieve.

Q. Should I build a greenhouse?

- I thought about this a lot, but I don't think I need it. At least not yet.
  - The shop I am planning to purchase the imported pachypus has posted a photo of the plants today and they seem to have planted them right after import in order to condition them to the local climate.
    - They will be unpotted to let the customers check root conditions.
  - I have heard that they have already cut the unhealthy parts of the root and confirmed it's health
  - It's getting warmer outside, so keeping the temperature high is less of an issue.
  - A lot of information online leads me to think that high humidity and high temperature is key to successful rooting of an imported plant, but there are a few things to consider here
    - Opeerculicarya Pachypus is endemic to Madagascar, where you do have high heat, but not much high humidity.
    - Making an artificially humid environment seems to be a forced way of promoting new root growth.
      - This makes the success rate unpredictable.
      - This is not necessary for a relatively healthy plant.
      - I theorize that it is a very extreme measure to take when you know the plant is slowly withering, and want to force new roots so that it can be conditioned again to revive.
        - This makes _starting with a healthy plant_ from the beginning more important

Q. How do I select a good healthy pachypus?

- If the caudex has white spotty marks, it's likely that it's rotting inside.
  - Less of a problem if it's already rooted.
  - Try to find something that has the least white spots on the body.
- Surviving green leaves are a sign that the caudex is still somewhat healthy.
- Hints of green on the caudex when sprayed means it is healthy.
- The larger the plant, the more stronger it is.
  - Thus more likely to have survived the stress while importing.
- There are already roots
- `Power tank` is not cut.
- It hasn't been long since it was imported.
- If you scratch the skin off, it's green.
- The trunk's skin has a bit of sheen to it.

## Post-mortem

- Well, it happened. I did purchase a bare root stock of a Pachypus.
- I spent two hours chatting with the owner and trying to pick which one I wanted.
- What was unusual for this kind of bulk sale of bare root stocks, is that the owner insisted that they show the cross section of the root to guage how healthy the stock is.
  - They did not refuse to sell it if its health was suboptimal, but it was a very nice gesture for them to show everyone what they are getting into.
- I have brought my purchase home and immediately potted them.
  - The details I will write in another note.
- I spent more than I would have liked to, but I couldn't have had a better first experience for bare root stock purchase. Well worth the price tag.
  - To clarify, it was a bargain considering the health of the stock and the extra mile they went to clarify it. I simply spent over my budget.

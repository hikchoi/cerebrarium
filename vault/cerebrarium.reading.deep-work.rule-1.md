# Rule #1

_**Work Deeply**_

## Eudaimonia Machine
- A state in which you're achieving your full human potential.
- A space designed to enable the deepest possible deep work.
- A work environment (and culture) designed to help us extract as much value as possible from our work.
- This is an _ideal_. We can't have this in the modern world.
- But we can try to emulate this by removing the things that are in our way.

## Simply reminding yourself to concentrate more isn't enough for deep work.
- You are constantly challenged with desire to do anything BUT work.
- _You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it_.
- You have to add _routines_ and _rituals_ on top of your good intentions to minimize these obstacles that block you from acheiving deep work.

## Strategies

### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy
- You need your own way of integrating deep work into your life.
- There is no right answer to this, but it is worth exploring what is right for _you_, as a incompatible depth philosophy may be of harm.
- Deploying deep work in an ad-hoc way is also not an effective way.

1. The Monastic
    - Maximize deep efforts by eliminating shallow obligations.
      - No emails, no phone calls, etc...
    - Completely going dark to focus on deep work.
    - Not so compatible with most people in a modern world.
1. The Bimodal
    - Divide and allocate a clearly defined stretch of time to deep work, and go back to normalcy when it's over.
    - Works only if you dedicate enough time to reach peak cognitive intensity.
      - Tends to be no shorter than a day.
    - For people who cannot simply be absent from their normal life to focus on their interests.
1. The Rhythmic
    - The _chain method_.
      - Easiest way to start deep work is to make it in to a regular habit.
      - Create a rhythm for this work and remove the _need to decide when_ it is best to switch to deep work.
    - By not spending energy to even think about when to go into deep work, you are removing a barrier to it.
    - In contrast to bimodal or monastic approach, this will likely not let you allocate enough time to reach your peak cognitive intensity, but it respects the reality of human nature.
      - In the long run, rhythmic workers will log more hours of deep work than bimodals.
    - A matter of self control. If nothing is pressuring you to do deep work (your life doesn't immediately depend on it), making it a habit is better.
    - In reality, your situation might not allow for long periods of deep work. In this case, you are locked into trying to make it a habit.
1. The Journalistic
    - Fitting deep work whenever you can in your schedule.
    - There will be a lot of context switching which can quickly deplete your willpower.
    - This assumes a certain level of confidence in your ability to focus.
    - Do it if you can pull it off. It won't be easy.

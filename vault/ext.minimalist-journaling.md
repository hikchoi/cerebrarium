- "The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic, long-term learning process, and not to live in a shell of static, safe mediocrity." - Josh Waitzkin.

- A common trait of successful people: consistency.
- Having motivation and time is not enough.
  - motivation weakening.
- Working on consistency is unpleasant and seem impossible.

- UI and OS Approach to habit tracking / journaling.
  - intentionally repurpose your psychology to work like a dashboard.
  - OS: your mind. complex and overwhelming.
  - UI: Like an app. a view into the mind specific to certain thing you want to acheive.

- Engaging in the things you want to improve / make habit of feels great, but the catch is you feel great _after_ the habit sticks to you.
  - Fin a way to run those _apps(habit tracking)_ whenever your _OS(mind)_ goes into crisis.

- achieveing lasting changes:
  - Awareness of the changes one desires to make.
  - Identifying problems and solutions.
  - Commitment to making the change.

Method
- Every morning draw a square. Each square is a day. At the end of the day you fill in the square with info.
- Remind yourself that every day is unique and will never happen again.
- Reassure yourself that even if I fail you will have another square for tomorrow.
- On the center of the square, record what you want to remember from that day. (wins. gratitude.)
- Mark on parts of the square what you want to track. This could be anything. Make it visual and appealing.
- Go over the squares periodically and retrospect.

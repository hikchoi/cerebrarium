## Notes
2021-07-13 08:22
- Downloaded [cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) to track macronutrients (mainly sodium)
- I was using Noom's subscription and had great results, but I don't need a personal coach for my habits anymore, and their tracking feature is a bit lackluster.
- Make it a habit to track what you eat. Activity tracking can come later. One thing at a time.
  - Not tracking nutrients for the sake of gathering data. Tracking for the peace of mind that I get for knowing what is going in to my body.

- I am not sure what part of my brain keeps me from executing on what gets me excited.
- One theory: my monkey mind is telling me it's too much commitment and steering me towards easy and immediate pleasures (distractions)
  - this saturates my free time with useless activities like staring at reddit all day.
  - in reality, the things that I _think_ is high commitment really isn't too much commitment, and is something that I would be proud that I've done it. certainly more so that just staring at my phone all day.
    - it also _drains_ me by the end of the day. when I draw, it keeps me focused and it requires a lot of energy.
    - it also gives me a sense of daily closure; that I have spent my time well that day. this helps remove the FOMO by the end of the day, which in turn lets my mind let go of the day and just go to bed.

- idea: daily routine presets.
  - Normally, I think starting my workday really early works best for me.
  - However, due to timezone differences there are days where I have to stay up late, which throws off my routine quite a bit.
    - In this case, I need to make enough buffer for me to relax before and / or after that routine break so that I can reliably resume back to my normal schedule.
  - Try out different time-blocking strategies for this and find a pattern.
  - Once a pattern arises, make it into a pattern and use it.
  - Every Tuesday for me is weekly planning at work, which happens at 11PM.
    - start my day as usual, or maybe a bit later (an hour or two), spend some personal time in the morning, and start work in the afternoon.
    - end with the weekly planning session, go to be immediately.

- ideas for logging my art process?
  - I want to be deliberate on what I focus on.
  - I want to log what goes through my mind when I draw.
  - Start something in [[cerebrarium.art]].
    - `.log`?
  - Start with a flat hierarchy for now and find patterns within the logs for structure later.

# Cerebrarium

> **Where I sow my cerebral seeds and tend to them.**

This is my current attempt to _**actively consume**_ information,
and also try to travel back in time and excavate what I have been dumping into my head without any consideration.

Most of the documents here will not make sense as they are working copies of my projects and ideas. I decided to share these publicly to facilitate easy sharing and _**thinking out loud**_

I plan to keep more polished and complete posts in my [main website](https://markhyunikchoi.com) and use this place as a nursery for my thoughts.

# Workflow

1. Start with the [Amoeba](https://www.dendron.so/notes/e780000d-c784-4945-8e42-35218a3ecf10.html) pattern.
2. Using the Ameoba method, let note creation come naturally.

3. Discover recurring structures and define schema later.

# Actionables

> A single place that lists immediately actionable tasks from various task.

## workflow
```
1. Add all actionable tasks into the inbox
2. Chop the tasks down to bite-size chunks
3. Move tasks into appropriate headings
4. Pick from the list of actionables what you should do today
5. Write that down in your physical daily note
6. Do it
7. At the end of the day (or when it is necessary), check what has been done
8. Every Sunday afternoon, go through the list and clean it up.
```

## notes
1. Keep this list as flat as possible. 
    - If a task needs a separate page for it, the scope of it is too large and probably doesn't belong here.
2. This list is not for every day chores or tasks that are necessary for basic survival.
    - Keep this in physical daily note
3. This list is not for work related tasks.

## inbox

> Unsorted list of actionables waiting to be categorized, or does not fit into a bigger topic. 
Task that need more breaking down also belongs here until it becomes actionable.

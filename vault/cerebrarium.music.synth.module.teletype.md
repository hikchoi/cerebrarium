## notes

**2020-12-31 9:31 PM**
- This build uses 2-56 screws and standoffs (Mcmaster 91780A023, 91772A077, 91772A073) that are kind of hard to find. Had to look for the datasheets for these and order alternatives. Hopefully they will fit.

- Along with the [[Veils panels|cerebrarium.music.synth.module.veils]], the panels for these were scratched. Perpendicular to the aluminum brushing. I suspect poor packaging on the seller's end. It was shoved in a plastic baggy barely big enough to fit both the panels and the pcb with no other protection (just in a box with a dozen more pcbs and panels). I was more frustrated with the poor quality of the Veils panels so I didn't mention these.

- Rest of the components that were missing arrived with the veils component order.
- I'm pretty excited for this build. It's pretty much a blank slate module that can do anything I can think of and code.

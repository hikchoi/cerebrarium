- Grabbed my first issue a few days ago.
- Seems I need a bit of ts/js + VSCode extension development primer so I've been on that for the last few days
- First going through [the typescript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/) to get myself familiar with typescript.
- [Kevin](https://www.kevinslin.com/) has kindly offered help to get me started with contributing. The community is very welcoming to newcomers.

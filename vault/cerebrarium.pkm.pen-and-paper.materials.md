> Jumbled notes on my journey of finding the perfect method of note-taking.

- I got a bundle of notebooks as a gift for entering kindergarten. 
- I wrote something down on the first page but I didn't like it.
- I tried to erase it but couldn't get the first page back to pristine condition. 
- This perturbed me so much that I tore it off my notebook and cried and never used that notebook again. 
- This is the first real memory that I have (and confirmed to be true) on note taking.
- It was a downhill battle of struggling to take perfect notes ever since.
- By the end of high school I have mananged to perfect my handwriting to a point where it closely resembles printed text.
- I spent more time perfecting my notes than actually absorbing the material.
- At this point I would buy dozens of notebooks and start over again if I made the tiniest mistake.
- Quickly learned that this strategy does NOT work in college at all, but I couldn't give up the perfect note.
- Started taking the opposite extreme path of having unintelligible notes during class. But I took it home and made a perfect copy and also aggregated additional information from textbooks, online resources, etc. This was extremely verbose and probably out of scope for undergrad, but it showed me that it can potentially be a knowledge base for me.
- I still wasn't the brightest kid in my class and I was a slow coder but everyone came to me for my notes.
- I heard that the copy of my notes were still circulating 2-3 years after I graduated.
- I do not have any of these left to share unfortunately.
- Towards the end of undergrad, I was using evernote but like a lot of evernote users, it became a write-only dump of notes that I would never go back to, which discouraged me from using it after a while.
- Then came grad school. I got interested in binding my own notebooks so I would always have a pocket sized handbound notebook with me.
- Unfortunately, a pocket sized notebook was not enough to contain reviews of academic papers and grad level course material so it just got filled with doodles.
- Due to reasons, I gave up on academia and then came the dark ages of (not) taking notes.
- Fast forward to late 2019, I was at work not satisfied with where my life was leading to, how unorganized my life was, etc.

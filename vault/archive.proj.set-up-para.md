# Set up PARA

- [x] Establish projects
    - [x] Pull out all actionable notes from [[cerebrarium]]
    - [x] put it all in [[proj]]
        - Do not think about the hierarchy or schema just yet. Just do it.
    - [x] Also create new entries for projects that you have thought about but never put into action.
- [x] tag statuses of all projects
- [x] tagging vs. categorization by hierarchy on projects
    - maybe time for a retrospect on this topic


## Notes

2021-03-27 12:08 AM
- The notion of `area` in the PARA method seems very vague.
- It almost feels like it's there to make the word `PARA` more catchy and roll off your tongue... A bit artificial? loosey goosey?
- It is clear that something not actionable (not a project) is an area, but how do you distinguish it from resources?
    - Is an `area` simply a think wrapper around `projects` and `resources`?
    - A categorization? 
- Will have to ponder a bit more on this after I've established all my `projects`

- Dendron's hierarchical way of organizing notes naturally eliminate the need to artificially set up the `area`s in PARA
- Simply not thinking about a rigid structure for PARA makes it much more easier to grasp the idea.

- It is a bit hard trying to navigate between projects.
- Using a flat hierarchy of `projects.*` is simple, but in the graph view everything is overlapping.
    - There is no distinction between _active_ and _pending_ projects.
    - Projects need to be archived to make room for other projects to become visible.
- The alternative is to ditch tagging with `tags.projects.[active|pending]` and simply making a `projects.active.*` hierarchy for currently active projects and `projects.pending.*` for planned projects.
    - Maybe also just have a local `projects.archived.*` hierarchy? I need to think about this.

- A lot of time has past, and I got distracted by a lot of the minutiae of life during that time.
- [[Tagging is broken|ext.tagging-is-broken]], and [[this article|ext.a-complete-guide-to-tagging-for-personal-knowledge-management]] goes deep into how tagging should work.
    - For now, I think this hierarchical project status tagging is sufficient.
    - Calling this done and will come back to this for incremental improvements.

# Project HANDS

## Goals
- Practice drawing hands.
- Do it pedantically, analytically, and exhaustively.

## Tasks
- [ ] Do a test run of ~~L00000~~
L11111 and find a repeatable pattern to follow for the rest of the poses.

## Logs

- Starting off with L00000
- Reference?
  - My hands.
  - A 3d posing software.
  - random pics from the internet.
- real references over 3d renders / pics.

- Just realized starting with L11111 would give me a better idea of what's going on in the hand. So change of plans. starting with [[proj.HANDS.L.11111]].
- Do I start with a tutorial? I have no idea how to draw hands.
- I first want to take a picture and draw over it to get a sense of what I can do without handholding (heh).

- pedantry should be followed by a reward.
- idea: after practicing and analyzing each hand pose, incorporate it into a fun drawing or a design.
  - try anything on it.
  - e.g.) for F11111, I could draw the hand, and make it into a tattoo design with whatever detail / style.
  - I think this is a good way to explore art styles.

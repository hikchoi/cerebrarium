## Notes
2021-07-10 17:44
- [[proj.habit-dashboard]] needs some attention.
  - I think this will be a great thing to go along with time-blocking.

- I need a separate place to hold [[external information that I am actively consuming|daily.journal.2021.07.06#^6KuDVWE4]]
- I don't think this needs to be a deep hierarchy.
  - What I am concerned here is the separation of _my own thoughts_ and the information that came from the _outside world_.
  - Notes I take from reading books and articles, watching videos rarely have my own spin on the idea. They are either:
    - Exact copy of the information.
      - usually when I want to recall the exact information from the source.
    - Minimally processed / paraphrased copy of the information.
      - summarized essence of the idea that I want to refer to later in my own thoughts.
- Applying a deep hierarchy in these would be unnecessary because a title that sufficiently describes the source of the information is enough to identify what I am trying to look up.
- More structure can be applied in my [[cerebrarium]] as a proxy, where I take those minimally processed ideas and mention them.
- By doing so, I am not spending time on categorizing external information as if I am compiling an encyclopedia of human knowledge.
  - I am intentionally keeping external information structure-less, to promote a free flow of thoughts between them.

- Cererbrarium still needs some pruning.

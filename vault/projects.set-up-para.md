# Set up PARA

- [ ] Establish projects
    - [x] Pull out all actionable notes from [[cerebrarium]]
    - [x] put it all in [[projects]]
        - Do not think about the hierarchy or schema just yet. Just do it.
    - [ ] Also create new entries for projects that you have thought about but never put into action.


## Notes

2021-03-27 12:08 AM
- The notion of `area` in the PARA method seems very vague.
- It almost feels like it's there to make the word `PARA` more catchy and roll off your tongue... A bit artificial? loosey goosey?
- It is clear that something not actionable (not a project) is an area, but how do you distinguish it from resources?
    - Is an `area` simply a think wrapper around `projects` and `resources`?
    - A categorization? 
- Will have to ponder a bit more on this after I've established all my `projects`

- Dendron's hierarchical way of organizing notes naturally eliminate the need to artificially set up the `area`s in PARA
- Simply not thinking about a rigid structure for PARA makes it much more easier to grasp the idea.

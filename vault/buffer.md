- I am feeling that I have very little use of keeping a [[daily.journal]].
- I never go back to my journals.
- Most content of the journal notes are meta things about other notes in [[cerebrarium]], so the important parts of those content end up going to the respective notes.
- I also don't use my journal in the typical bullet journal way. 
  - I don't write tasks in my journal.
  - The _daily_ distinction here is completely irrelevant.
  - I don't write agendas or any event that need my attention in the journal.
  - This makes the existence of _daily journals_ a bit of a nuisance.
    - I feel a slight obligation that I _have_ to write a journal every day, and otherwise I haven't spent quality time that day.
    - This is absolutely not the case, but having the [[daily.journal]] hierarchy kind of facilitates that kind of thinking for my monkey mind.
- Experiment with using this buffer note for everything that you did in the daily journal for a while, and consider archiving the entire daily hierarchy.

- Experimenting having explicit tasks defined in my physical journal.
- My physical notebook is only for my immediate concerns that are procedural.
- Cerebrarium is for more abstract things.
- I didn't want to keep todo lists in Cerebrarium, but didn't think that I would have to keep it _somewhere_, otherwise it would slip away.
  - I always had the task _work on cerebrarium_ but without any specific task. This didn't help me get on to the task right away, and figuring out what I should do for it each day was a blocker for me.

[[ext.art-and-fear]]
- This was a wonderful book that taught you about the various fears you would get by being an artists as well as what it meant to be an artist.
- The first part of the book was very interesting and useful for me, but part 2 was mostly irrelevant, so I have omitted it from summarizing them.
  - About career and academia within the art field.
  - I may get back to it if I ever get involved in that, but not for now.
- Main points that resonated with me:
  - [[Making art means facing uncertainties and doubts|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^KyVEyFcV2lyU]]
    - I think this is a very practical definition.
    - As a person with a lot of anxiety in general, I am very prone to avoid things that are uncertain. Uncertainty paralyzes me. I think this is part of the root cause of what I've been struggling to figure out.
      - How much I love and fantasize about making art, it doesn't come as easy. I have very short bursts of drive for making art which quickly dwindles down.
    - The book goes straight to the point, and is very convincing:
      - [[Making art means despite these hurdles you find meaning within the work itself|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^GBvJ5I9iGGqU]]

[[Chapter 1|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1]]
- The first chapter establishes some assumptions the authors are making in order to describe what the fears are and what it means.
  - [[Artmaking involves skills that can be learned|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^AcUEhhFXDSys]]
    - A typical cliche advice that people give to struggling artists, but the important distinction is that they emphasize that _accepting yourself_ and _following your own voice_ is something that can be learned, and thus means _being an artist is something that you can teach yourself to do_.
  - [[Art is made by ordinary people|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^vc0OUGjsSfn4]]
    - Describes the common pitfalls all artists fall into: believing that the _good_ ones are special. Also a cliche advice, but the reasoning is interesting.
      - That it is _necessary_ to be an ordinary person to make art, because it is what drives the artist.
  - [[Making art and viewing art are different|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^YHpWMDrfGp2U]]
    - What matters to you is what you get out of the process, what matters to others is the end result. This point is further explained in [[Chapter 4|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-4]].
  - [[The notion of art being a self-expression can be a double edge sword|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^MpBMOMvu6nPo]]
    - This is something a lot of artists believe, and the danger of doing so is that it's easy to think that you are flawed because your art is flawed (or you think it is).
    - It's arguable, I generally agree with this, but it feels weaker than the other points.
- What can I get out of this?
  - One actionable I can think of is a small manifesto about how I would approach artmaking, that I can come back to whenever I am struggling and need a refresher on what my fears are.

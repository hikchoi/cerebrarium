- I am feeling that I have very little use of keeping a [[daily.journal]].
- I never go back to my journals.
- Most content of the journal notes are meta things about other notes in [[cerebrarium]], so the important parts of those content end up going to the respective notes.
- I also don't use my journal in the typical bullet journal way. 
  - I don't write tasks in my journal.
  - The _daily_ distinction here is completely irrelevant.
  - I don't write agendas or any event that need my attention in the journal.
  - This makes the existence of _daily journals_ a bit of a nuisance.
    - I feel a slight obligation that I _have_ to write a journal every day, and otherwise I haven't spent quality time that day.
    - This is absolutely not the case, but having the [[daily.journal]] hierarchy kind of facilitates that kind of thinking for my monkey mind.
- Experiment with using this buffer note for everything that you did in the daily journal for a while, and consider archiving the entire daily hierarchy.

- Experimenting having explicit tasks defined in my physical journal.
- My physical notebook is only for my immediate concerns that are procedural.
- Cerebrarium is for more abstract things.
- I didn't want to keep todo lists in Cerebrarium, but didn't think that I would have to keep it _somewhere_, otherwise it would slip away.
  - I always had the task _work on cerebrarium_ but without any specific task. This didn't help me get on to the task right away, and figuring out what I should do for it each day was a blocker for me.

[[ext.art-and-fear]]
- This was a wonderful book that taught you about the various fears you would get by being an artists as well as what it meant to be an artist.
- The first part of the book was very interesting and useful for me, but part 2 was mostly irrelevant, so I have omitted it from summarizing them.
  - About career and academia within the art field.
  - I may get back to it if I ever get involved in that, but not for now.
- Main points that resonated with me:
  - [[Making art means facing uncertainties and doubts|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^KyVEyFcV2lyU]]
    - I think this is a very practical definition.
    - As a person with a lot of anxiety in general, I am very prone to avoid things that are uncertain. Uncertainty paralyzes me. I think this is part of the root cause of what I've been struggling to figure out.
      - How much I love and fantasize about making art, it doesn't come as easy. I have very short bursts of drive for making art which quickly dwindles down.
    - The book goes straight to the point, and is very convincing:
      - [[Making art means despite these hurdles you find meaning within the work itself|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^GBvJ5I9iGGqU]]

[[Chapter 1|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1]]
- The first chapter establishes some assumptions the authors are making in order to describe what the fears are and what it means.
  - [[Artmaking involves skills that can be learned|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^AcUEhhFXDSys]]
    - A typical cliche advice that people give to struggling artists, but the important distinction is that they emphasize that _accepting yourself_ and _following your own voice_ is something that can be learned, and thus means _being an artist is something that you can teach yourself to do_.
  - [[Art is made by ordinary people|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^vc0OUGjsSfn4]]
    - Describes the common pitfalls all artists fall into: believing that the _good_ ones are special. Also a cliche advice, but the reasoning is interesting.
      - That it is _necessary_ to be an ordinary person to make art, because it is what drives the artist.
  - [[Making art and viewing art are different|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^YHpWMDrfGp2U]]
    - What matters to you is what you get out of the process, what matters to others is the end result. This point is further explained in [[Chapter 4|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-4]].
  - [[The notion of art being a self-expression can be a double edge sword|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-1#^MpBMOMvu6nPo]]
    - This is something a lot of artists believe, and the danger of doing so is that it's easy to think that you are flawed because your art is flawed (or you think it is).
    - It's arguable, I generally agree with this, but it feels weaker than the other points.
- What can I get out of this?
  - One actionable I can think of is a small manifesto about how I would approach artmaking, that I can come back to whenever I am struggling and need a refresher on what my fears are.

[[Chapter 2|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-2]]
- [[Quitting means not starting again, but art is all about starting again|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-2#^QgLc00UDcxI2]]
  - This pretty much sums up everything about chapter 2.
- The reasons artists quit doesn't really seem to apply to me _yet_, but it may be something that I have to think about later on.
  - Convincing themselves that their next effort will fail
  - Lose destination.
  - I'm probably closer to the former than the latter, because I haven't really found a destination at all yet, and I'm still very much struggling to learn how the materials react to what I do to them.
- [[Make friends with others who make art, and share your work frequently|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-2#^beDUjUvSguJQ]]
  - This is prime advice.
  - I feel like I never had people to share my work, and on any rare occasions I've shared, it felt great and gave me a lot of drive.
- Some strategies that I can immediately try to implement for myself:
    1. Remind yourself that it's natural that sometimes the result of executing your vision can be disappointing.
    2. What you have the most control over is how the material reacts to your input.
        - Practicing more and just _doing a lot of work_ will give you more control over the material.
    3. Other than that, it's all about how _you_ react to the uncertainties.
        - Train yourself to be resilient to surprises and mistakes.
        - Use this as your advantage: stash these mistakes and discrepancies between your vision and execution and make sure you address that on your next project.
          - Your next project will have more of those for the next one as well.
          - _Not_ having those would probably mean another type of artistic death.

[[Chapter 3|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-3]]
- [[It is impossible to pretend to be an artist|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-3#^rMDCTFEKrQzE]]
  - You either do art or you don't.
  - Getting good reactions from your work is a completely separate thing from _being_ an artist. You did the work, you _are_ an artist. Simple as that.
  - I wonder if I ever thought like this.
    - I do sometimes think I'm pretending, but it's because I'm not really physically doing any work at all, and just _fantasizing_ about doing it.
      - I guess it's a valid thing to say in this case.
      - Probably not healthy to keep that thought lingering around though.
      - Let's try to use this as a reminder that we are _hesitating_ for some reason, and find a way to put down that first brushstroke.
        - Once the strokes flow out, this feeling tends to go away from me, which is at least a good sign that I'm not falling into this unhealthy ideation.
- [[Use the imperfections to your advantage moving forward|ext.art-and-fear.chapter-3#^63VoyHdA8jil]]
  - Art should be _fueled_ by imperfection, and used as something that will guide you through your subsequent works.
  - Making note of the things I need to improve and time-boxing my project to a certain deadline could artificially create a cycle where I am incrementally improving myself.
    - This can be true for both _familiarity of material_, and _how I react to my own work_.
    - _Aim for 75%_, which is my mantra for everything could also be applied here.
      - How do we quantify the work you are doing?
        - I can't quantify _how good_ my work is; at least without a prior definition of my goals.
          - The goal really has to be quanitfiable as well so no good.
        - If I can come up with a quantifiable goal before I start any project, that would be great.
          - But this may become yet another blocker for doing actual work and prefering incremental growth.
          - Can I come up with a rule-of-thumb-ish general goal that I can use for any project?

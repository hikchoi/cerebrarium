Notes for SF concept art

## Form and structure of Mecha

- Parts
  - In sci-fi, we aren't creating something comepletely new from nothing.
  - So we should understand how things that exist in real life works
    - look at parts from cars, bikes, aircrafts, etc
    - especially look at how moving parts are connected to the main body of a vehicle / machine
      - hinges
      - wheels
      - pneumatics
    - what are the function of these parts in the machine as a whole?
    - things that are hidden but appear when it is needed.
    - _why_ does it look that way?
      - shape
        - can it look different and function the same?
        - can it be bigger?
        - can we have multiples of the same part, and if so, will if function the same?
        
      - location
        - can it be attached somewhere else and function the same?
        
- pistons
- hinges
- cylinders
- doors
- plate detail
  - parting lines of each plate
  - how they are bolted together
    - distance between bolts
- wires
  - why are these wires here?
    - what is being sent here?
    - where is it coming from?
    - where is it connected?

- going back to the notion of "science fiction is based on real life", it is natural that we base each individual part of a mechanism off real life.
- without this, there would be no connection to real life.
  - Say we are designing a propeller for this sci-fi concept.
    - Just manipulating shapes to be "futuristic" and adding non-sense parts around it to make it look complex would not work.
      - The viewer would need to find a connection between this concept and real life, and have a reasonable understanding of how that thing works.
- sillouette can come later
  - the designer can have complete freedom here as long as it still holds a pinch of truth and maintain the connection.

- this doesn't mean you need to have deep understanding of how mechanisms work in real life.
- but the things that are visible in the design, e.g.) how a cylinder is placed and how it moves, are bound to the realm of real life physics. You can't make that up.
  - locally, where the viewer's focus would go, would need to have something that looks like it would _work_.

- _plausibility_ is the name of the game.
  - having the freedom to design a un-real, out of the world object, that looks like it would work if it were a real thing.

- discovering interesting mechanisms in real life reference that could be generalized and used in different parts of your design then, is an important skill to hone when you are designing sci-fi concepts

- look at sizes of bolts, sizes of cylinders and pipes and how they twist and turn
  - you don't have to _understand_ why they are like that, but they are good grounding points to the real world.

- reduce a reference down to parts that are _essential_.
  - try to preserve them functionally in your design.
  - the rest can then be then imagined to look like something out of the world and appealing.
    - again, within the constraint of conventional understanding of what this object exists for.

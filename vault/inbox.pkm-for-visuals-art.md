# Explore possibilities of using PKM tools for visual art

Creating (visual) art can seem like a pretty intuitive and impromptu task, but in reality there are a lot of similarities between visual art and writing. Like writing, there is a whole spectrum of artist that on one end start a drawing from a blank paper and goes by their gut feeling, and on the other end, meticulously build up their visual libraries and accumulate studies on various topics until they reach to their final goal.

It would be interesting to see how the pkm tools can be adapted for people in the visual art world.

Start gathering material on how artists tackle their visual libraries, start there to find analogies in the pkm world.

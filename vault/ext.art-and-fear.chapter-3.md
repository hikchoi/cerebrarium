## Fears About Yourself
- _When you act out of fear, your fears come true._
- Two types of fear:
  - Fear about yourself
    - Prevents you from doing your best
  - Fear about the reception of your work by others.
    - Prevents you from doing you own work.

### Pretending
- Fear that you are just pretending to do art.
- Comes from doubting your credentials as an artist.
- Sometimes you will hit a wall and work becomes slow. Here, if you believe that art can only be made by extraordinary people, this wall will confirm that you are not.
- Art (both making and viewing) takes a lot of energy, and the _art is for extraordinary people_ mindset gives you an excuse to quit.
- You may sometimes feel like you are pretending to be an artist, but this is impossible.
  - Your work not being recieved well or not being exhibited somewhere does not make you a pretender. This is a completely different issue.
- Someone has to do an artist's work, and you are doing it.

### Talent
- Talent is about _what comes easily_, and you will reach a point where things don't come easily.
- Pondering about how much talent you have is the most wasteful thing you could do in art. It is also the most common sentiment artists have.
- Talent _may_ give someone a head start, but without direction or goal it is meaningless.
- Those who rely on talen will peak quickly and fade quicker.

- Mozart improved his work by working.
- Artist get better by improving their skills / learning new ones
  - by working.
  - by learning new things from their past work.

- Why does it not come easily then?
  - Because art is hard.

- Practical questions about talent
  - Who cares? Nobody.
  - Who would know? Nobody.
  - What difference will it make? None.

### Perfection
- Art is human, error is human, _ergo_, art is error.
- Your art will inevitably be flawed.
- If art needs to be perfect, no existing work would qualify as art.
- To require perfection is to invite paralysis.
- Demanding perfection is to deny humanity.
- The seed of you next work lies within the imperfections of your current piece.
  - These are your guides that are valuable and reliable.
  - These give meaning to the art you are making.

### Annihilation
- Some equate themselves with their art too much that they equate not making art with not being.
- This is a common but mostly overdrawn existential fear that some part of you dies when you stop making art.
- It is true, and the risk of not doing work depends on your need and desire to make stuff.

### Magic
- _Maybe making art requires something special, something magical, that I don't have?_
- This belief gives you the need to prove that your work does have some magic to it.
- With this mindset, when the work does turn out good, you are inclined to believe it's a fluke. If it doesn't, it's an omen.
- There might be something special needed in order to make art, but it isn't a universal one. It will be personal to each individual artist.
  - But it doesn't matter.
  - Point is, whatever that person has, even if you had it, it wouldn't help. If _you_ had some kind of magic, it will help, but you probably don't need it.

### Expectations
- Balance between imagination and calculation.
  - Too much imagination: you are filled with fantasies
  - Too much calculation: you spend your life generating to-do lists.
- Expectations can very easily drift into imagination.
  - Almost always leads to disillusionment.
- Expectations based on the work itself is the most useful to the artist.
  - What do you need to do on your next piece? The last piece has the information.
  - Your work is your guide and reference.
- So you need to look at your work without judegment / need or fear / hopes / expectations.
- It is about asking what your work needs, not what _you_ need.

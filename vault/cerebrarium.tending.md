# On tending my Cerebrarium

1. Open a note
1. Ask yourself: Does this note deserve to stay?
  1. If the answer is no, delete the note.
    - This is a note that has to be pruned.
    - Maybe you wanted to get to this topic, but never got a chance.
    - It might not be relevant anymore. Maybe you aren't interested in it that much.
    - It's already overwhelming to spend time on stuff that you are actively interested in.
  1. If the answer is yes, ask yourself again: Do you need to work on it?
    - If the answer is no, this note is good as is.
      - You might get a chance to improve it in the future, but don't force it.
    - If the answer is yes, think about explicit actionable tasks to do so.
      - Turn it into a project.
1. Mark it with appropriate metadata so that you can identify the status of the note easier in later sessions.

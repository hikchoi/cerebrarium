> **Kickstart Accidental Contraptions**
> Due: 

## Tasks
- [ ] ~~plan out Accidental Contraptions Q1 roadmap~~
- [ ] Retrospect on what has been holding me back
- [ ] Roll out plans and a sensible deadline to get things done.

## Notes
2021-07-04 14:52
- This is something that I gave myself until end of Q1 to get to a point where I can make prints for 2-3 finished pieces, but fell off for other things.
- This is worth getting back to as art is currently something I am active trying to work on.
- Let's get back to this during July and set out a plan to move this forward.

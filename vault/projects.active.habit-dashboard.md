# Habit Dashboard

> **Implement your own version of Habit Dashboard**
> Due: 2021-07-11

## Context
- Stumbled upon [this](https://betterhumans.pub/draft-how-to-hack-your-brain-to-achieve-consistency-that-lasts-7f5fdc520d28) the other day
- It talks about the UI/UX of a analog habit tracking dashboard.
- I lack the way to track my habits in my current journaling setup and this looks something worth experimenting.

## Actionables

- [ ] Read and take notes on the aforementioned article.
- [ ] Implement the method in my own journaling setup.

## Notes
2021-07-04 14:43
- I never started this. Life got in my way.
- I probably should have done it back then when life was getting in my way in retrospect.
- This does look like something that can go along with [[deep work|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work]], so I should do this soon.
- Let's keep this in our daily and carry over until it's done.
  - Giving myself a week to implement and start using it.

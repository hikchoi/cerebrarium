## Context
- Stumbled upon [this](https://betterhumans.pub/draft-how-to-hack-your-brain-to-achieve-consistency-that-lasts-7f5fdc520d28) the other day
- It talks about the UI/UX of a analog habit tracking dashboard.
- I lack the way to track my habits in my current journaling setup and this looks something worth experimenting.

## Actionables

- [ ] Read and take notes on the aforementioned article.
- [ ] Implement the method in my own journaling setup.

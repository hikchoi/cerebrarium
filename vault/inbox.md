# Inbox

> A giant dumping ground where I put all the things I want to save but don't have time to give a proper hierarchy.
> Everything is appended here and regularly pruned into it's appropriate places.
>
> Try to leave a simple note on each inbox item so you have a context to work with when you get to it later.

# Operculicarya Pachypus

This is the king of caudex (in my opinion).

Ever since I've discovered the wonderful world of caudiciforms, I've been drooling over the idea of obtaining a Pachypus.

This is a plant endemic to Madagascar, and is very tricky to root after importing.
The soil is removed and the roots and so-called `power tank` is cut to prevent the soils from entering the destination country.

Today (2021-02-27) I visited my [go-to store](https://www.goreplantseoul.com/) for caudices to potentially purchase a small senna meridionalis (which I did), and the owner kindly offered me to pick up a unrooted, possibly dead Pachypus for free.

I figured I would dare try to root it and if I fail it still is an absolutely beasty looking plant so I could keep it as a trinket or decoration.

This is a tricky plant and not a lot of information is out there on the interent.
The most actively discussed place seems to be Japan, and I am now maniacally searching the web for japanese caudex blogs for 発根管理(root management) of pachypuses.

What I have gathered so far is the following:

1. Good draining soil.
2. Soak in root conditioner before potting.
3. Keep pot warm. mid 30 degrees celcius.
4. Water when soil just barely gets dry.
5. Spray HB-101 and the likes and water several times a day
6. Be patient and enjoy the ride.

To be completely honest I have no expectation of successfully rooting this beast as even for fresh and well maintained imports the success rate is supposedly 10%

Since I am not confident in rooting a Pachypus (or even any plant in that matter), I would go with the advice of [this post](https://twelvedesign.jp/2019/07/05/operculicarya-pachypus-pet-bottle-1-2/) and use a transparent pot to at least give me a visible indication of how the roots are doing.

Now I need to mix up a suitable well draining soil.
For this I am following the advice of [this post](https://inuairon.com/pachypodium-soil/)

For heating, I've considered wrapping the pot with a heated blanket, buying a sous-vide machine and submerging the pot, just having a heated blanket below the pot, etc.

the sous-vide machine method I now realize cannot be done as we cannot effectively drain the pot, and I'm scared of the humidity.

I'm also a bit scared of the fire hazard of wrapping the heated blanket AROUND the pot, as I think it's not meant to be bent while using.

I will have to use a heated blanket just under the pot and maybe wrap the pot with some heat retaining material so that the soil is evenly heated throughout the day.
I think they sell pads for pots but [this post](https://inuairon.com/pachypodium-rooting/) shows me you can use a heating pad for reptiles. In [this post](https://codexgreen.com/unexplained-pachypus_purchase_3/) they use a foot warmer.

I am not sure if I should soak the thing in root conditioner (like clone X or oxyberon) since it was already done by the shop owner. I'm going to go against my gut feeling and skip this as I don't know the effect of doing this repeatedly.

- Purchased all materials needed for mixing the soil, heating the pot, as well as a plastic.

- [codexgreen](https://codexgreen.com/) logs the journey of rooting 4 pachypuses. This is very interesting. Out of the 4, they managed to succeed 3 times. second one being the failure. It is a very detailed log for root managing the plant.
- I have a very dangerous feeling that I'll be sucked into this more deeply... The glorious feeling of successfully rooting a Pachypus and then seeing fresh leaves sprouting is something I want to experience myself.
- The only thing that holds me back is the sheer cost and risk. It seems like starting with a healthy, strong stock is vital for success, and this means getting a larger stock that can survive the stress while importing / rooting. This also means that I will have to shell out a big chunk of money to source this, which I am currently not ready to do.
- My best bet is to pretend what I currently have in hand has a possibility to survive, and to try out the seedlings.

- Quite a bit of time has past since I started looking into pachypuses (pachypi?), but along the way I decided there is no way this is going to survive so I just left it as is.
- However, I did purchase a very small and not-tubular pachypus for a relatively cheap.
  - It is currently getting used to the environment and has several bits where the new leaves are about to form.
- Also, apparently there will be a bulk sale of yet-to-be-rooted pachypuses at a new store.
- So now I'm coming back to the topic and trying to gather information so I can be prepared to try out rooting it myself.

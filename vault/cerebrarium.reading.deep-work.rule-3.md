# Rule #3

_**Quit Social Media**_

- Your willpower is limited.
- Social media feeds your short-circuited brain instant gratification.
- You have less time and energy for deep work.
- These tools are not inherently evil.
  - If you can find value in it, feel free to use them.
  - But don't operate under the _any-benefit_ mindset.

## The _Any-benefit mindset_.
- Justifying the use of social media if you can identify _any_ possible benefit from it.
- This ignores the negatives that come with social media.

- Throughout history, skilled laborers have meticulously thought about choosing the right tools for them, and knowledge workers should do the same.

## The _Craftsman Approach_ to tool selection.
- Identify the core factors that determine success.
- Adopt the tool if it increase the likelihood of said success, even after factoring in the negatives that come along with it.

## Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits
- 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes.
- a.k.a the Pareto principle, 80/20 rule, principle of factor sparsity.
- If you spend time on the low-impact activities, you are taking away time that could otherwise be spent on high-impact activities.

## Quit Social Media
- You are not really missing out.
- People don't actually _want to hear what you have to say_.
  - Social media is designed to give you an easy way to signal your opinion to others.
    - _You "like" my status update and I'll "like" yours. This agreement gives everyone a simulacrum of importance without requiring much effort in return.

## Don't use the Internet to Entertain Yourself
- Outside of the 8 hour workday, you have 16 hours all to yourself.
- Treat them like a day within a day, not a prologue or epilogue to your "work day".
- Deliberately making use of your day outside the time you work.
- Put more thought into your leisure time.
  - Don't default to what grabs your attention at the moment.
  - Spend some time thinking what you can do with your time instead.
- Some may say adding structure to your leisure time will make you more tired for the next work day, but this is not the case.
  - It will _increase_ the value instead.
  - What your mind needs is _change_ not _rest_. They don't get tired like your limbs.
    - Except until you do need to rest (e.g. attention fatigue, etc.), which is why we sleep.
- If you give your mind something meaningful, your day will be more fulfilled and be ready to start a new one the next day.

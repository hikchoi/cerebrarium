- References and cheatsheets.
  - Notes that are strictly instructional and give reference to things that I look up on the internet a lot.
  - There aren't a lot of abstract thinking going on here, so it might be a good idea to keep this separate from [[cerebrarium]] and reduce the noise there.
  - These are also different from what [[ext]] hierarchy has because I am not really _actively consuming_ the content of these. I am simply noting them for later reference.
  - This hierarchy can use a lot of schemas and will be more hierarchy-heavy than link-heavy.
- Actionables:
  - start `ref.*` hierarchy.
  - sort out all ref notes in vault and refactor.

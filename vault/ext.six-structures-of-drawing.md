- Six steps on how you can learn to draw anything and provide you with a better understanding of form, design, and structure.

1. Structuralization ^4vaguD59043v0Dla
    - Basics. 
    - Learning to draw the simple shapes.
    - Learning how to draw them, cluster them, combine them intuitively.
    - Spacial awareness.
    - Good sense of believability.

2. Manipulation
    - (Shape) manipulation.
    - Taking the primitives and learning how to 
      - bend and twist them.
      - squash them
    - Manipulating contours, sections, edges.

3. Observation
    - We don't need to first educate what's going on in an object to draw it. (e.g. we don't need to know everything about human anatomy to draw a human figure).
      - With the previous steps, you can structuralize and manipulate simple shapes after observing what's in front of your eyes to come up with something believable, that resembles the object.
    - Mannequin-ize the stuff you see.

4. Education
    - Now we are trying to educate ourselves about the things we observed and approximated.
    - e.g. studying the underlying muscles / bones after approximating what you've observed to come up with a human figure drawing.

5. Imitation
    - Learn from peers to what visual language they are using to structuralize / manipulate objects.
    - Building the catalogue of the art styles of other artists that you admire or your eyes are drawn to. Learning what they are doing.
      - In turn slowly developing a style of your own.
    - Analyze

6. Imagination
    - Coming up with something of your own with everything you've done in the previous steps. from scratch.

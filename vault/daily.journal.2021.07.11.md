## Notes

- time-blocking retrospect
  - it's working great.
  - I am using the left page for the normal habit / tasks entry and the right page for time blocks.
  - I was first worried that my tiny pocket notebook will not be large enough for multiple columns of time blocks, but turns out all I need is 4.
    - divide page into half.
    - each half is then divided again into half.
      - left side for initial time blocks.
      - right side for edited time blocks (if applicable).
        - most of the time this is enough as you don't really fix your time blocks more than once at any given time.
  - time-blocking ahead will be a little bit tricky until you can reliably predict when you are going to wake up.
  - I mark with a red line when I checked and revised the time blocks. No real use, but just a simple indicator that I have mindfully reviewed the blocks throughout the day.
  - I may start adding more indicators for each block as necessary.

- Thoughts while pruning notes.
  - I am not sure what I want to do with the [[cerebrarium.botany.plants]] hierarchy.
    - Since the hierarchy is for _plants_, it does make sense to have individual hierarchies for the family / genus.
    - However that structure is generating unnecessary nodes when I don't really have a lot of them.
    - I think the structure here is prematurely applied.
  - [[proj]] hierarchy needs some rethinking.
    - Do I need both `queued` and `backlog`? Let's keep it simple.
    - mentally, there are three categories here:
      - Will do
      - Doing
      - Done
    - If I made a project page, it means I have to _commit to it_.
    - I shouldn't make a page for it if I think I will get to it someday.
    - My thought with the separation of `queued` and `backlog` was that the backlog will hold anything that I _might_ do some day, and queued was for thing that I _will_ do in a very near future, just not right now.
    - This distinction I feel is unnecessary.
  - Let's do this incrementally. I can't get to all notes each time.

- Consulted with my doctor to taper off my bp meds.
  - We've tapered off a good chunk of them, but now I have palpitation of my heartbeat.
  - My worries that the taper has reversed my bp to a higher point has been confirmed with regular bp measures at home.
    - Hovering at around 130/85-ish, I would like to get this down close to 120/80 before I continue with the taper.
    - When I am fully calmed down for measurement, it reads around 125/85.
  - The past 4 months or so I have been a bit lazy with being mindful about what I am eating.
    - More frequent eating out.
    - More frequent food delivery.
    - Generally more use of sodium.
  - I should look into DASH and adapt it to my meal plans.
    - Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH_diet
    - https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/heart/dash_brief.pdf
  - A lot of information to digest in one sitting.
  - I need a plan to gradually introduce this.
  - For each meal that I regularly eat, I'll try to measure the servings in terms of DASH and see what I need to add / remove to those. (use page 3 / 4 of [[ext.lowering-your-blood-pressure-with-dash]])

  - green beans

    - sodium: 3mg
  - chicken thighs
    - 100g
    - sodium: 86mg

- This amounts to 1250mg of sodium.
- grains
  - 2.6 servings
- vegetables
  - 6-7 servings
- poultry
  - 3.6 servings
- legumes
  - 1 serving
- fats and oils
  - 1 serving

- After this one meal, I am left with:
  - 3-4 servings of grain
  - no veggies
  - 4-5 fruits
  - 2-3 servings of dairy
  - 2.4 servings of lean meat / poultry / fish
  - no nuts / seeds / legumes
  - 1-2 servings of fats

- Usually one of my meals will be:
  - Greek yogurt with some granola and frozen berries, maybe a tsp of jam
  - Salad
  - Another rice/noodle based meal.

- I may be eating a bit too much nuts / legumes mainly from the granola mix with greek yogurt
- I don't drink milk, so yogurt is the only dairy I get. I may need more.
- Not a lot of fruits in my main dishes, but I do try to eat them as snacks.
  - the amount I eat as snacks (and sometimes in a salad) probably covers the fruit servings.
- I may be going over the fats servings with the unaccounted amount of fat that are in other ingredients.
- I will have to start measuring what is going into my salad dressings to accurately measure how much I should be eating that.
- I generally don't really find sweets in my snacks but there are times when I drink a bit of juice. Just try to be mindful when you eat and it'll be within limits.
- look at how much sodium intake is in rest of your meals and it should be good.

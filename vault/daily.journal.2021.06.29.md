[[daily.journal]]

- Deep work resonated with me deeply. I will try to internalize this way of working both professionally and personally.

[[cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1]]
- I need to come up with v1 of my own _Eudaimonia Machine_.

- Depth philosophy
  - The [[Monastic|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1#^Fop4AVPo]] approach is near impossible for me to implement.
  - The [[Bimodal|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1#^2zHHwu66]] approach is something I can partially implement.
    - I can dedicate a day out of my weekends to do deep work for a set amount of time on my non-professional endeavors.
    - During the week, I will be spending time in a deep work state for my professional work.
      - Since [[my willpower is limited|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1#^Y0Ql_XBV]], it might not be a good idea to schedule a non-professional deep work session any day during the week.
      - This could change if I don't keep a distinction between my professional work and my personal work since there are quite a few overlaps between them. However, some personal work is just worth separating from work...
  - The [[Rhythmic|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1#^Gqkgruf8]] approach seems like the most sane solution for my professional work.
  - As the author suggests, the [[Journalistic|cerebrarium.reading.deep-work.rule-1#^tdNLbh_j]] approach is not something for a novice deep worker.
    - I may come back to this later when I have successfully internalized other aspects of deep work, but for now this is beyond my ability.

> Dedicate enough time during the weekends for deep work sessions on your personal endeavors. 

> During the week, make it a habit of rhythmically doing deep work during work.

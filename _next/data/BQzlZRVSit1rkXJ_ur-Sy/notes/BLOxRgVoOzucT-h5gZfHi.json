I am neither of those (at least as a profession).</li>\n<li>I do however write for myself. With the breadth of topics and interests I have, it has been proven for many years (of my experience) that I cannot keep up with it.</li>\n<li>The main audience I want to reach is my future self and possibly the few people who are interested in looking into my brain while I <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu\">work with my garage door open</a>.</li>\n<li>Not all of this will have a end result of a piece of writing shipped. Some of these will become an art piece, a habit, or a dish; generally anything that is a part of my life.</li>\n<li>In a more generalized sense, the main outcome of my Zettelkasten will be <em>actions</em>. From notes I take while I absorb various information, I aim to extract actions that I can take so that my act of reading doesn't stop at just reading. Not all reading should end up in something actionable, but I will carefully and actively curate what I absorb so that at some point in my knowledge work, it leads to an action.\n<ul>\n<li>This action in turn, could end up becoming an art piece, a habit, or a piece of writing.</li>\n<li>It is then crucial for me to adapt other action-oriented methods such as GTD or PARA along with Zettelkasten.\n<ul>\n<li>One could say Zettelkasten implicitly is couple with the act of writing. This seems true. I am aiming to generalize this to my other interests incrementally.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fleeting-notes-and-literature-notes\">Fleeting notes and literature notes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#fleeting-notes-and-literature-notes\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I take notes in a lot of places: my phone (a quick message to myself), on a piece of paper, a pocket notebook, etc.</li>\n<li>Once they serve their purpose, I delete them. I don't think it's worth storing them in a central place.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"919a3a68-d78d-4403-aca5-ea6e722ca35b","title":"Cerebrarium","desc":"","updated":1640613661592,"created":1608971683570,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"cerebrarium","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"608b5806f5a9617a1356f40276dc6043","links":[{"from":{"fname":"ext","id":"Y_H6rBwXIinOO1QtrsNLV","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":40,"column":87,"offset":2834},"end":{"line":40,"column":102,"offset":2849},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"ext","id":"Y_H6rBwXIinOO1QtrsNLV","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":99,"offset":3059},"end":{"line":42,"column":114,"offset":3074},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"inbox.do","id":"sKXyyWh2Ltz34Yor","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":31,"offset":157},"end":{"line":6,"column":46,"offset":172},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.proj.set-up-para","id":"3e110afd-f3d7-4e65-a6a2-68386e385830","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":46,"offset":86},"end":{"line":5,"column":61,"offset":101},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.07.06","id":"YkY2M2OBrECDzy7tJUm8u","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":19,"offset":1162},"end":{"line":23,"column":34,"offset":1177},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.07.06","id":"YkY2M2OBrECDzy7tJUm8u","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":30,"offset":1483},"end":{"line":26,"column":45,"offset":1498},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.07.06","id":"YkY2M2OBrECDzy7tJUm8u","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":31,"column":19,"offset":1886},"end":{"line":31,"column":34,"offset":1901},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.07.10","id":"PiWkMf8_aK-TI3h1foE9t","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":22,"offset":259},"end":{"line":7,"column":37,"offset":274},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.07.10","id":"PiWkMf8_aK-TI3h1foE9t","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":39,"offset":1355},"end":{"line":24,"column":54,"offset":1370},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.07.11","id":"voYNbQ3CnDingwFbsRjsG","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":22,"offset":102},"end":{"line":4,"column":37,"offset":117},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"},{"from":{"fname":"archive.daily.journal.2021.08.03","id":"gPOBTIoz1O5t9BrS","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":114,"offset":270},"end":{"line":5,"column":129,"offset":285},"indent":[]},"value":"cerebrarium"}],"anchors":{"cerebrarium":{"type":"header","text":"Cerebrarium","value":"cerebrarium","line":10,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["f52825ef-7efe-4373-9784-255b9a058deb","815d5e1b-44ea-476a-868d-5fada4342924","jARgLS1htcLm5h3qdnuC8","65cb4031-d3d3-4e1a-a295-b96693df9d52","fc872c52-b139-4f32-80d5-9fcf05b41621","Jytev4B6USaFF48P","e6765163-38b4-42eb-a122-0d8ccca6ae22","ZtihdRyqFJMCdlVjMPuZj"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-20-14-44-18.png)\n\n# Cerebrarium\n\n> **Where I sow my cerebral seeds and tend to them.**\n\nThis is my current attempt to _**actively consume**_ information,\nand also try to travel back in time and excavate what I have been dumping into my head without any consideration.\n\nMost of the documents here will not make sense as they are working copies of my projects and ideas.
